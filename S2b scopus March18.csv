The bias may enhance pre-sleep arousal, such as excessive worry about sleeplessness, which prevents people from initiating normal sleep onset. The present study focused on (a) attention bias toward sleep-related stimuli and (b) difficulty in updating working memory for sleep-related stimuli as two possible mechanisms underlying pre-sleep cognitive arousal. Method: Participants (n = 61, a community sample) completed a dot-probe task (with sleep-related and matched control word stimuli) and a 1-back and 2-back task (with sleep-related and non-sleep-related pictorial stimuli). Results: For the dot-probe task, the results showed no significant association between pre-sleep cognitive arousal and sleep-related attention bias. However, the results of the 2-back task suggest that pre-sleep arousal is associated with decreased interference by sleep-related stimuli in maintaining non-sleep-related information. That is, individuals with higher levels of pre-sleep arousal are more efficient at processing sleep-related materials. Limitations: The non-clinical nature of the sample may limit the clinical implications of the findings. Conclusions: Although the current results cannot be explained by the extant cognitive theories of insomnia, we offer an alternative explanation based on the idea of worry as mental habit: mental processes that occur frequently (e.g., repetitive thoughts about sleep) require less cognitive resource. Therefore, sleep-related information may be processed easily without consuming much cognitive effort. © 2018","Arousal; Attention bias; Sleep; Working memory; Worry","adult; arousal; Article; attention test; attentional bias; cognition; controlled study; dot probe task; female; human; human experiment; information processing; male; mental function; n-back test; sleep; task performance; working memory","AFAvH, American Friends of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; PF/10/005, KU Leuven","Keisuke Takano was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.

We examined their relative and combined efficacy compared to control conditions in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods Ninety-five adults diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD), were randomly allocated to 4 groups: ABMT + CBM-I control (hereafter ABMT; n = 23), CBM-I + ABMT control (hereafter CBM-I; n = 24), combined ABMT + CBM-I (n = 23), and combined control (n = 25). Treatment included eight sessions over four weeks. Clinician-rated and self-reported measures of social anxiety symptoms, functional impairment, and threat-related attention and interpretive biases were evaluated at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results ABMT yielded greater symptom reduction as measured by both clinician-ratings (Cohen's ds = 0.57-0.70) and self-reports (ds = 0.70-0.85) compared with the CBM-I, the combined ABMT + CBM-I, and the combined control conditions. Neither of the other conditions demonstrated superior symptom change compared to the control condition. No group differences were found for functioning or cognitive biases measures. Limitations Limitations mainly include the mix of active and control treatments applied across the different groups. Therefore, the net effect of each of the treatments by itself could not be clearly tested. Conclusions Results suggest superiority of ABMT compared to CBM-I and their combination in terms of symptom reduction. Possible interpretations and methodological issues underlying the observed findings are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attention bias; Cognitive bias modification; Interpretation bias; Social anxiety; Treatment","adult; Article; attention bias modification treatment; attentional bias; behavior modification; cognitive bias; cognitive bias modification of interpretation; controlled study; female; follow up; functional disease; human; interpretation bias; major clinical study; male; patient-reported outcome; randomized controlled trial; self report; social phobia; threat","2013349, BARD, United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund; 2013349, BARD, United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund","This work was partially support by the United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) for YBH - 2013349.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of oxytocin on attentional processes towards anger in patients with BN. Method: The study design consisted of a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover, single dose experiment. Sixty-four women (31 patients with BN and 33 healthy comparisons) completed self-reported measures to evaluate emotional difficulties and were administered a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (40IU) or placebo followed by a visual probe detection task to examine attentional orienting to angry or happy faces. Results: Patients with BN reported higher emotional dysregulation and more difficulties in controlling anger compared to the healthy comparison group. Patients with BN and the healthy women exhibited similar attentional bias to angry faces in the placebo condition. Intranasal oxytocin reduced the attentional bias towards angry faces in both the BN patients and the healthy women. Conclusions: We found that a single dose of oxytocin reduced vigilance towards angry faces in patients with BN as well as healthy women. The results showed that patients with BN are not different from healthy women in terms of vigilance towards threat. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anger; Attentional bias; Bulimia nervosa; Emotional regulation; Oxytocin",,"2016R1D1A1A09917877, MOE, Ministry of Education; NRF, National Research Foundation of Korea","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2016R1D1A1A09917877).

Methods: Seventy-four healthy volunteers completed spontaneous EEG measurement, a self-report trait anxiety questionnaire and a dot-probe task with stimuli of different threat-level and 200 and 500 ms cue-target delays. Results: Participants with high TBR directed attention towards mildly threatening and avoided highly threatening pictures. Moreover, the most resilient participants, (high TBR and low trait anxiety) showed attention towards highly threatening stimuli. There were no effects of delay.

However, prior studies have mostly utilized sleep-related words and images, and research is yet to examine whether people with insomnia display an attentional bias for sleep-specific (i.e. tired appearing) facial stimuli. This study aimed to examine whether individuals with insomnia present an attentional bias for sleep-specific faces depicting tiredness compared to normal-sleepers. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the presence of an attentional bias was characterized by vigilance or disengagement. Forty-one individuals who meet the DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder and 41 normal-sleepers completed a dot-probe task comprising of neutral and sleep-specific tired faces. The results demonstrated that vigilance and disengagement scores differed significantly between the insomnia and normal-sleeper groups. Specifically, individuals with insomnia displayed difficulty in both orienting to and disengaging attention from tired faces compared to normal-sleepers. Using tired facial stimuli, the current study provides novel evidence that insomnia is characterized by a sleep-related attentional bias. These outcomes support cognitive models of insomnia by suggesting that individuals with insomnia monitor tiredness in their social environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attention; Cognitive bias; Disengagement; Faces; Insomnia; Tiredness; Vigilance",,"Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison","This research was supported by the Department of Psychology, Sociology and Politics at Sheffield Hallam University .",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041685366

Two dot-probe tasks (with the duration of the stimuli lasting 100 ms and 500 ms, respectively) were employed to compare the attentional bias of 35 elderly people to that of 35 young adults. The stimuli used were expressive faces displaying neutral, disgusted, fearful, and happy expressions. In comparison to young people, the elderly allocated more attention to happy faces at 100 ms and they tended to avoid fearful faces at 500 ms.

Aberrant emotional attention, particularly among individuals high on aggression, constitutes one such deficit; however, its robustness across race/ethnicity requires further investigation given findings that the psychopathy construct manifests differently across race (Sullivan and Kosson 2006), and emotional attention is susceptible to the influence of adverse environmental factors such as violence exposure that is more common among ethnic minority youth (Kimonis et al. in Development and Psychopathology, 20, 569–589, 2008b). Also, the development of a comprehensive measure of CU traits, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), has identified specific CU dimensions (Uncaring, Callous, Unemotional) that are yet to be investigated in relation to emotional attention deficits. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether aggressive boys high on total CU traits and specific ICU dimensions show deficits in attentional orienting to negative stimuli on a dot-probe task that are consistent across race/ethnicity. Results from a predominately Latino sample of incarcerated male adolescents (N = 156) showed that aggression moderated the association between CU traits and facilitation to distress stimuli. That is, aggressive boys high on CU traits or the Uncaring dimension showed deficient attentional orienting; a finding that was consistent across racial/ethnic minority groups. Results are consistent with prior research suggesting that the combination of high CU traits and aggression defines a unique subgroup of antisocial individuals that more closely fits with the construct of psychopathy than the presence of CU traits alone. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Callous-unemotional traits; Dot probe task; Emotional attention; Emotional processing; Juvenile psychopathy; Latino",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016987012

Results indicated there were no differences in attentional bias or amount eaten between self-control conditions and dietary restraint groups.

Previous studies suggest that obese youngsters have an attentional bias and an automatic approach tendency towards high-calorie food and display difficulties inhibiting impulses, which may result in a higher intake of (high-calorie) food. An interesting idea for improvement of the current obesity treatment is adding a program that enables to train their difficulties. Subjects were 36 youngsters aged 9–15 years old from an inpatient treatment program for obesity, randomized over a training group and an active control group. The training consisted of six training sessions with cognitive tasks aimed at enhancing inhibition towards unhealthy food items (with a go/no-go task), as well as decreasing a food approach bias (using an approach/avoidance task) and a food attentional bias (using a dot-probe task). The current study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability and initial effectiveness of the training and explores if these characteristics helps obese youngsters to maintain weight-loss once they return home at the end of their inpatient treatment program. Results on the cognitive performances were investigated during two measurement sessions, spread over 5 weeks while weight evolution was followed over 13 weeks. Results showed that the training program was feasible and acceptable to the majority of participants and clinicians.

The current experiments, inspired by performance magic, explore the extent to which entrainment can occur across sensory modalities. Across two experiments using a difficult dot probe detection task, we find that the mere presence of an auditory rhythm can bias when visual attention is deployed, speeding responses to stimuli appearing in phase with the rhythm. However, the extent of this cross-modal influence is moderated by factors such as the speed of the entrainers and whether their frequency is increasing or decreasing. In Experiment 1, entrainment occurred for rhythms presented at .67 Hz, but not at 1.5 Hz. In Experiment 2, entrainment only occurred for rhythms that were slowing from 1.5 Hz to .67 Hz, not speeding.

Variable effects of ABM training on anxiety and ABs generate conflicting research recommendations, novel ABM training procedures, and theoretical controversy. This article summarises an updated cognitive-motivational framework, integrating proposals from cognitive models of anxiety and attention, as well as evidence of ABs. Interactions between motivational salience-driven and goal-directed influences on multiple cognitive processes (e.g., stimulus evaluation, inhibition, switching, orienting) underlie anxiety and the variable manifestations of ABs (orienting towards and away from threat; threat-distractor interference). This theoretical analysis also considers ABM training as cognitive skill training, describes a conceptual framework for evaluating/developing novel ABM training procedures, and complements network-based research on reciprocal anxiety–cognition relationships. Research in experimental psychopathology has led to the development of ABM training as a potential computer-delivered treatment for anxiety disorders. Conventional ABM threat-avoidance training encourages anxious individuals to orient attention away from threat, but has variable effects on anxiety and threat-related ABs. Differing explanations for mixed outcomes of ABM training, and theoretical controversy about the causes of anxiety and ABs, encourage the development of alternative novel ABM training methods. Development of effective attention-based treatments for anxiety would be advanced by better theoretical understanding of the cognitive processes underlying anxiety and ABs, and by using more refined and comprehensive assessments of threat-related attention and associated cognitive and neural functioning. © 2018 The Authors",,"Biology; Cognitive model; Cognitive process; Cognitive skill; Cognitive theory; Comprehensive assessment; Conceptual frameworks; Threat avoidance; Training procedures; Cognitive systems; anxiety; attention; cognition; conceptual framework; human; medical education; medical research; Review; salience network; skill; threat",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041573947

Attentional biases consisting of increased attention to negative, mood congruent stimuli and reduced attention to positive, mood-incongruent stimuli are postulated but have rarely been tested for early attentional processing. Furthermore, the role of concurrent depressive mood as a moderating factor has not been studied to date. Participants comprised 30 patients suffering from MDD and 30 healthy control subjects. All participants performed a dot-probe task with pictorial stimuli displaying affective facial expressions, presented either for 100 ms or for 500 ms. Attentional biases towards faces displaying joy in both MDD patients and control subjects and towards faces displaying pain in MDD subjects were found at presentation times of 100 ms. In the MDD sample, the bias indices at 100 ms were correlated with concurrent depressive mood. In patients with pronounced depressive mood, significant biases towards happy and angry faces were observed that exceed the biases obtained in control subjects and patients with less depressive mood. The results provide first evidence that MDD patients with pronounced depressive mood show an increased early attentional engagement towards emotional salient stimuli, independent from valence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Attention; Attentional bias; Cognition; Depression; Neuropsychology","adult; Article; attention; attentional bias; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; dot probe task; emotion; facial expression; female; happiness; human; major depression; male; neuropsychological test; pain; priority journal; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040319120

Participants performed a dot-probe task with pictures of naturally fear-relevant (snake or spider) or -irrelevant (bird or butterfly) stimuli. Instructions indicated that two pictures (one naturally fear-relevant and one fear-irrelevant) could be followed by an electrical stimulation (i.e., instructed fear). In reality, no stimulation was administered. During the task, two pictures were presented on each side of the screen, after which participants had to determine as fast as possible on which side a black dot appeared. After a first phase, fear was reinstated by instructing participants that the device was not connected but now was (reinstatement phase). Participants were faster when the dot appeared on a location where an instructed fear picture was presented. This effect seemed independent of whether picture content was naturally fear-relevant, but was only found in the first half of each phase, suggesting rapid extinction due to the absence of stimulation, and rapid re-evaluation after reinstatement. A second experiment similarly showed that instructed fear biases attention, even when participants were explicitly instructed that no stimulation would be given during the dot-probe task. Together, these findings demonstrate that attention can be biased towards instructed fear stimuli, even when these fear relations were never experienced. Future studies should test whether this is specific to fear, or can be observed for all instructions that change the relevance of a given stimulus. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Attention; Dot-probe; Fear conditioning; Instructed fear; Learning via instructions",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028828568

A wealth of research has been conducted to examine attentional biases toward body-related information among individuals with eating pathology. However, there is considerable variability in the methods that have been used to measure attention and, importantly, these methods tap into different attentional processes. Given the multifaceted nature of attention, it is important for researchers to select the right tools to test their hypotheses. This review critically evaluates the attentional measures that have been used in previous research, primarily the modified Stroop task, dot probe task, visual search task, and eyetracking. The strengths and limitations of each measure will be discussed in order to provide a guide for researchers to further investigate the attentional mechanisms underlying body image issues and eating disorders.

Inconsistent findings may arise due to substantial methodological variability and limited sample sizes, emphasizing the need for systematic research on large samples. The aim of this report is to examine the association between threat bias and pediatric anxiety symptoms using standardized measures in a large, international, multi-site youth sample. Methods: A total of 1,291 children and adolescents from seven research sites worldwide completed standardized attention bias assessment task (dot-probe task) and child anxiety symptoms measure (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders). Using a dimensional approach to symptomatology, we conducted regression analyses predicting overall, and disorder-specific, anxiety symptoms severity, based on threat bias scores. Results: Threat bias correlated positively with overall anxiety symptoms severity (ß = 0.078, P =.004). Furthermore, threat bias was positively associated specifically with social anxiety (ß = 0.072, P =.008) and school phobia (ß = 0.076, P =.006) symptoms severity, but not with panic, generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety symptoms. These associations were not moderated by age or gender. Conclusions: These findings indicate associations between threat bias and pediatric anxiety symptoms, and suggest that vigilance to external threats manifests more prominently in symptoms of social anxiety and school phobia, regardless of age and gender. These findings point to the role of attention bias to threat in anxiety, with implications for translational clinical research. The significance of applying standardized methods in multi-site collaborations for overcoming challenges inherent to clinical research is discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anxiety/anxiety disorders; biological markers; child/adolescent; computer/internet technology; GAD/generalized anxiety disorder; international; phobia/phobic disorders; SAD/social anxiety disorder/social phobia; separation anxiety",,"A.F.W.

We tested the temporal interplay between trauma exposure, dysregulated attentional processing of threatening information pre- and post-trauma, and the development of posttraumatic intrusions. Methods: Response time to trauma-related threat, trauma-unrelated threat, as well as to trauma-related but typically emotionally-neutral stimuli was assessed using the dot probe task before and one week after watching a violent movie scene that served as a trauma analogue. AB was analyzed as a dynamic process by means of a recently developed approach indexing momentary fluctuations of AB toward and away from emotional stimuli. Posttraumatic intrusions were measured daily over the week following analogue trauma exposure. Results: We found that key features of AB dynamics to trauma-related stimuli at post-, but not pre-, trauma exposure were associated with posttraumatic intrusions. Notably, these post-trauma exposure effects were specific to biased attentional processing of trauma-related but not threatening stimuli unrelated to the traumatic event. In line with a growing body of findings, pre- and post-trauma exposure traditional aggregated mean AB scores were not similarly associated with posttraumatic intrusions. Conclusions: We conclude that one mechanism through which trauma exposure may contribute to the development of PTSD is through its dysregulation of attentional processing of trauma event-related cues. Future work may focus on delineating the developmental course through which attentional dysregulation post-trauma and posttraumatic intrusions unfold and interact. © 2018","Attention; Attentional bias; Cognition; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Sexual assault; Trauma","adult; Article; attentional bias; emotion; exposure; female; human; major clinical study; male; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychotrauma; response time; risk assessment; stimulus response; task performance; threat; violence","TU Dresden, Technische Universität Dresden; TU Dresden, Technische Universität Dresden","This study was funded by funding opportunities for young scientists (Anschubfinanzierung) from the Department of Psychology of the Technische Universität Dresden.

Methods: One-hundred forty women classified in a prior longitudinal study as having low (n = 73) or persistent high (n = 67) distress completed 2 modified dot-probe tasks assessing attention bias and an ambiguous cues task assessing interpretation bias toward cancer-related vs neutral information. Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Four-way repeated analysis of variance was adopted. Results: Participants with persistent high distress from the original study who continued to report high Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale scores (≥8) on recruitment into the present study comprised the persistent distress group (ie, 31 reporting high anxiety and 30 reporting high depression scores). Persistent distress and low distress groups did not differ in attentional bias toward negative-stimuli or cancer-related information, but a significant time-course effect in attentional bias toward negative-stimuli or cancer-related information was observed, with women in the persistent distress group showing a significant bias away from negative-stimuli or cancer-related information under supraliminal conditions. There was a borderline difference in interpretation bias scores between low anxiety and chronic anxiety groups (P =.065), with correlation suggesting a significant positive association (r = 0.20, P =.019). Conclusion: Women with persistent distress may adopt avoidance strategies to cope with breast cancer. Moreover, women reporting persistent anxiety may have a tendency to negatively interpret ambiguous information, leading to illness preoccupation. These findings offer critical insight for clinicians to develop tailored interventions to help women with persistent psychological distress.

Examining biases in multiple processes has been theorised to be more predictive than examining bias in any process alone. Anhedonia is a core symptom of psychopathology and predictive of future psychopathological symptoms. Finding that combined biases are associated with anhedonia would advance knowledge of the nature of emotional processing biases and the value of objective performance-based measures for identifying early risk markers. Participants (N = 139) completed tasks that assess latency bias (dot probe) and biased recognition (two-alternative forced-choice) of emotional information, as well as an anhedonia measure. An index was computed for each task’s performance reflecting biased processing of positive and negative words. Only combined biases on both tasks were associated with anhedonia. Attentional bias was positively associated with anhedonia, but only when recognition bias for emotional words was high. Thus, assessing biases in multiple domains increased sensitivity to uncover relationships between emotional processing biases and anhedonic symptoms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accuracy; anhedonia; attentional bias; Dot probe; latency",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016481567

Therefore, reducing attentional bias to food could possibly be beneficial in preventing impulsive eating. The importance of chewing has been increasingly implicated as one of the methods for reducing appetite, however, no studies to investigate the effect of chewing on attentional bias to food. In this study, we investigated whether chewing stimulation (i.e., chewing tasteless gum) reduces attentional bias to food as well as an actual feeding (i.e., ingesting a standardized meal) does. We measured reaction time, gaze direction and gaze duration to assess attentional bias toward food images in pairs of food and non-food images that were presented in a visual probe task (Experiment 1, n = 21) and/or eye-tracking task (Experiment 2, n = 20). We also measured appetite ratings using visual analog scale. In addition, we conducted a control study in which the same number of participants performed the identical tasks to Experiments 1 and 2, but the participants did not perform sham feeding with gum-chewing/actual feeding between tasks and they took a rest. Two-way ANOVA revealed that after actual feeding, subjective ratings of hunger, preoccupation with food, and desire to eat significantly decreased, whereas fullness significantly increased. Sham feeding showed the same trends, but to a lesser degree. Results of the visual probe task in Experiment 1 showed that both sham feeding and actual feeding reduced reaction time bias significantly. Eye-tracking data showed that both sham and actual feeding resulted in significant reduction in gaze direction bias, indexing initial attentional orientation. Gaze duration bias was unaffected. In both control experiments, one-way ANOVAs showed no significant differences between immediately before and after the resting state for any of the appetite ratings, reaction time bias, gaze direction bias, or gaze duration bias. In conclusion, chewing stimulation reduced subjective appetite and attentional bias to food, particularly initial attentional orientation to food. These findings suggest that chewing stimulation, even without taste, odor, or ingestion, may affect reward circuits and help prevent impulsive eating. © 2018 Ikeda, Miyamoto, Usui, Taira and Moriyama.","Appetite; Attentional bias; Chewing; Eye-tracking; Reward circuit; Visual probe task",,"26713055, JSPS, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","The authors thank Ms. Masako Akiyama (University Research Administration Office, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan) for her advices of statistical analysis in this article.

Landscape architecture is composed of a series of natural elements that have significant evolutionary implications. The present study used one pilot material ratings and three experiments to examine the mechanisms of aesthetic appraisals of landscape architecture. The results confirmed that landscape architecture elicited a sense of beauty and captured visual attention more easily than other types of architecture during explicit aesthetic rating task (Experiment 1) and implicit aesthetic perception task (dot-probe paradigm, Experiment 2). Furthermore, the spatial cueing paradigm revealed that response latencies were significantly faster for landscape architecture than non-landscape architecture on valid trials, but there was no significant difference in this contrast on invalid trials at 150-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA, Experiment 3a). At 500-ms SOA (Experiment 3b), participants responded significantly faster for landscape architecture on valid trials, but reacted significantly slower for landscape architecture on invalid trials. The findings indicated that the beauty of landscape architecture can be perceived implicitly, and only faster orienting of attention, but not delayed disengagement of attention was generated at early stages of the processing of landscape architecture. However, the attentional bias at later stages of attentional processes may be resulted from both faster orienting of attention and delayed disengagement of attention from landscape architecture photographs. © 2018 Zhang, Tang, He and Lai.","Aesthetic appraisal of landscape architecture; Attentional bias; Delayed attentional disengagement; Evolutionary aesthetics; Faster orienting of attention",,"2017BQ076, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2017M612661), the grants (grant number 51378212 and 31671132) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number 2017BQ076)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041833240

This study examined the effect of a novel attention training protocol, attention bias modification (ABM), on symptomatic, behavioral, and neural risk markers in children with behavioral inhibition. Method: Nine- to 12-year-old typically developing children identified as having behavioral inhibition (N = 84) were assigned to a 4-session active ABM training (n = 43) or placebo protocol (n = 41) using a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial approach. Anxiety symptoms (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children–Fourth Edition), attention bias (AB; measured by a dot-probe task; AB = incongruent reaction time − congruent reaction time), and AB-related neural activation (measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging activation for the incongruent > congruent contrast in the dot-probe task) were assessed before and after the training sessions. Results: Results showed that active ABM (n = 40) significantly alleviated participants’ symptoms of separation anxiety, but not social anxiety, compared with the placebo task (n = 40); ABM did not modify behavioral AB scores in the dot-probe task; and at the neural level, active ABM (n = 15) significantly decreased amygdala and insula activation and increased activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared with placebo (n = 19). Conclusion: These findings provide important evidence for ABM as a potentially effective protective tool for temperamentally at-risk children in a developmental window before the emergence of clinical disorder and open to prevention and intervention.

Psychological treatments are an integral aspect of intervention, but a proportion of individuals still relapse despite having received such an intervention. Recently, the dual-process theory proposed that the unconscious processes of attention biases are responsible for these relapses. Prior meta-analyses have reported the presence of attention bias in alcohol and tobacco use disorders. More recent research has examined attention bias and its effectiveness in opiate use, cannabis use, and stimulant use disorder. The evidence syntheses to date have not examined whether attention bias is present in these disorders and could be subjected to manipulation. This is important information and would support the introduction of psychological interventions for attention bias for such patients. Such psychological interventions would help individuals maintain their abstinence and minimize the risk of relapse. Objective: This paper aims to undertake a systematic review to synthesize the existing evidence for the presence of attention bias in all the disorders mentioned above, and to determine the clinical efficacy of attention bias modification. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted. A search will be conducted on the respective databases up till 2017. Selection of the studies will be determined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Quality assessment of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A narrative synthesis will be conducted, with a meta-analysis considered only if there are sufficient studies for statistical analysis. Results: The results of the systematic review will be available 12 months after the publication of this protocol. Conclusions: This review is important as it will support the introduction of psychological interventions for attention bias for such patients. Such psychological interventions would help individuals maintain their abstinence and minimize the risk of relapse. � Melvyn Zhang, JiangBo Ying, Guo Song, Roger CM Ho, Daniel SS Fung, Helen Smith.","Attention bias; Substance addiction; Systematic review",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042088176

Method: Thirty eight Dutch CFS participants were compared to 52 CFS and 51 healthy participants recruited from the UK. Participants completed self-report measures of symptoms, functioning, and mood, as well as three experimental tasks (i) visual-probe task measuring attentional bias to illness (somatic symptoms and disability) versus neutral words, (ii) interpretive bias task measuring positive versus somatic interpretations of ambiguous information, and (iii) the Attention Network Test measuring general attentional control. Results: Compared to controls, Dutch and UK participants with CFS showed a significant attentional bias for illness-related words and were significantly more likely to interpret ambiguous information in a somatic way. These effects were not moderated by attentional control. There were no significant differences between the Dutch and UK CFS groups on attentional bias, interpretation bias, or attentional control scores. Conclusion: This study replicated the main findings of the UK study, with a Dutch CFS population, indicating that across these two cultures, people with CFS demonstrate biases in how somatic information is attended to and interpreted. These illness-specific biases appear to be unrelated to general attentional control deficits. © 2017, The Author(s).","Attentional bias; Attentional control; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Cross-cultural study; Interpretation bias",,"NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; CMHWR, Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research; King’s College London","Funding AMH, CH, and TC receive salary support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London, and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London.

This study examines how these two types of attention training modulate neurological dysfunction in veterans with PTSD. A community sample of 46 combat veterans with PTSD participated in a randomized double-blinded clinical trial of ACT versus ABMT and 32 of those veterans also agreed to undergo resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Twenty-four veterans completed psychological and MEG assessments at pre- and post-training to evaluate treatment effects. MEG data were imaged using an advanced Bayesian reconstruction method and examined using statistical parametric mapping. In this report, we focus on the neural correlates and the differential treatment effects observed using MEG; the results of the full clinical trial have been described elsewhere. Our results indicated that ACT modulated occipital and ABMT modulated medial temporal activity more strongly than the comparative treatment. PTSD symptoms decreased significantly from pre- to post-test.

This involuntary cognitive process is considered as attentional bias (AB). AB has been hypothesized to have causal effects on drug abuse and drug relapse, but its underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. This study investigated the neural basis of AB in abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs), combining event-related potential (ERP) analysis and source localization techniques. Electroencephalography data were collected in 21 abstinent heroin addicts and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) during a dot-probe task. In the task, a pair of drug-related image and neutral image was presented randomly in left and right side of the cross fixation, followed by a dot probe replacing one of the images. Behaviorally, AHAs had shorter reaction times (RTs) for the congruent condition compared to the incongruent condition, whereas this was not the case in the HCs. This finding demonstrated the presence of AB towards drug cues in AHAs. Furthermore, the image-evoked ERPs in AHAs had significant shorter P1 latency compared to HCs, as well as larger N1, N2, and P2 amplitude, suggesting that drug-related stimuli might capture attention early and overall require more attentional resources in AHAs. The target-related P3 had significantly shorter latency and lower amplitude in the congruent than incongruent condition in AHAs compared to HCs. Moreover, source localization of ERP components revealed increased activity for AHAs as compared to HCs in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), superior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for image-elicited responses, and decreased activity in the occipital and the medial parietal lobes for target-elicited responses. Overall, the results of our study confirmed that AHAs may exhibit AB in drug-related contexts, and suggested that the bias might be related to an abnormal neural activity, both in early and late attention processing stages. © 2018 Zhao, Li, Hu, Li, Gillebert, Mantini and Liu.","Attentional bias; Dot-probe task; Event-related potentials; Heroin-related cues; P3; Source localization","action potential amplitude; adult; age; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; correlational study; electroencephalography; event related potential; gender; heroin dependence; human; inferior frontal gyrus; latent period; major clinical study; male; mental task; posterior cingulate; response time; stimulus response; superior parietal lobule; task performance",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041452675

This training targets the late disengagement from negative stimuli and the lack of attention for positive information, which are characteristics of depression. In the present study, 75 dysphoric students (BDI ≥ 9) were randomly assigned to either this positive training (PT), or a sham-training (ST) that did not train any valence-specific gaze pattern (positive and negative pictures had to be disengaged from and attended to equally often). Results showed that the PT induced a positive attentional bias (longer fixations of positive than negative pictures). Although the ST group showed an increase in positive attentional bias as well, this increase was not as strong as in the PT group. Compared to the ST, the PT specifically induced faster disengagement from negative pictures. No differential training effects were found on stress responses or state rumination. These results show that the ET-ABM successfully modifies attentional processes, specifically late disengagement from negative stimuli, in dysphoric students, and hence might be a promising alternative to existing ABM paradigms. © 2018 The Author(s)","Attention bias modification; Attentional disengagement; Depression; Eye-tracking","adult; article; attentional bias; controlled study; eye tracking; female; gaze; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; rumination; stimulus; stress; student",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040606170

After a silent stimulus has captured attention, it is passed on to the attentive stage where it can affect decision making and responding. Numerous studies show that the presence of self-referential information affects almost every cognitive level. These effects may share a common and fundamental basis in an attentional mechanism, conceptualized as attentional bias: the exaggerated deployment of attentional resources to a salient stimulus. A gold standard in attentional bias research is the dot-probe paradigm. In this task, a prominent stimulus (cue) and a neutral stimulus are presented in different spatial locations, followed by the presentation of a target. In the current study we aimed at investigating whether the self-face captures, holds and biases attention when presented as a task-irrelevant stimulus. In two dot-probe experiments coupled with the event-related potential (ERP) technique we analyzed the following relevant ERPs components: N2pc and SPCN which reflect attentional shifts and the maintenance of attention, respectively. An inter-stimulus interval separating face-cues and probes (800 ms) was introduced only in the first experiment. In line with our predictions, in Experiment 1 the self-face elicited the N2pc and the SPCN component. In Experiment 2 in addition to N2pc, an attentional bias was observed. Our results indicate that unintentional self-face processing disables the top-down control setting to filter out distractors, thus leading to the engagement of attentional resources and visual short-term memory. © 2018 Wójcik, Nowicka, Kotlewska and Nowicka.","Attention; Attentional bias; ERP; N2pc; Self-face; Self-recognition; SPCN",,"2015/19/B/HS6/01258, NCN, Narodowym Centrum Nauki","This work was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (2015/19/B/HS6/01258 to AN).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040315174

Compared to research on substance use, however, few studies have examined attentional biases in gamblers using eye-gaze tracking, which has many advantages over other measures of attention. In addition, previous studies of attentional biases in gamblers have not directly matched type of gambler with personally-relevant gambling cues. The present study investigated the specificity of attentional biases for individual types of gambling using an eye-gaze tracking paradigm. Three groups of participants (poker players, video lottery terminal/slot machine players, and non-gambling controls) took part in one test session in which they viewed 25 sets of four images (poker, VLTs/slot machines, bingo, and board games). Participants’ eye fixations were recorded throughout each 8-second presentation of the four images. The results indicated that, as predicted, the two gambling groups preferentially attended to their primary form of gambling, whereas control participants attended to board games more than gambling images. The findings have clinical implications for the treatment of individuals with gambling disorder.

In two experiments, observers discriminated between different types of artificial fish. In parallel, a secondary, variable-SOA visual-probe detection task was used to examine the dynamics of visual attention. In Experiment 1, the fish varied in three distinguishing features: one indicating the general category (saltwater, freshwater), and one of the two other features indicating the specific type of fish within each category. As predicted, in the course of recognizing each fish, attention was allocated iteratively to the distinguishing features in an optimal manner: first to the general category feature, and then, based on its value, to the second feature that identified the specific fish. In Experiment 2, two types of fish could be discriminated on the basis of either of two distinguishing features, one more visually discriminable than the other. On some of the trials, one of the two alternative distinguishing features was occluded. As predicted, in the course of recognizing each fish, attention was directed initially to the more discriminable distinguishing feature, but when this feature was occluded, it was then redirected to the less discriminable feature. The implications of these findings, and the interactive-iterative framework they support, are discussed with regard to several fundamental issues having a long history in the literatures on object recognition, object categorization, and visual perception in general. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bottom-up processes; Distinguishing features; Interactive; Iterative; Object categorization; Object recognition; Top-down processes; Visual attention","accuracy; algorithm; Article; classification; controlled study; diagnostic value; human; human experiment; identity recognition; normal human; occlusion; perception; priority journal; saccadic eye movement; species comparison; undergraduate student; vision; visual attention; visual information; visual system","University of Haifa; ISF, Israel Science Foundation","This research was supported by grant 1110/10 from the Israel Science Foundation to Ruth Kimchi and Morris Goldsmith, and comprises part of Orit Baruch’s Ph.D dissertation, submitted to the University of Haifa.

The relationship between alcohol use and cocaine dependence shown in literature justify the need of study these two substances jointly. Methods This paper analyzes patterns of attentional bias in 71 patients with cocaine dependence and compares these patterns according to whether occasional or problematic concurrent alcohol use is taken into account. It also analyzes whether attentional bias towards alcohol and cocaine-related stimuli predicts treatment retention. Attentional bias was evaluated with a visual probe task between 15 and 20 days after admission to treatment. Treatment status was recorded at a three-month follow-up. Severity of dependence and cocaine and alcohol craving were also measured. Results Results show that patients with cocaine dependence and problematic alcohol use show a pattern of approach towards alcohol stimuli (M = 8.32, SD = 27.01). In contrast, patients with cocaine dependence with occasional consumption of alcohol exhibit a pattern of avoidance of such stimuli (M = −7.23, SD = 19.20) (t = 2.79, p = 0.007). Logistic regression indicates that alcohol attentional bias is the only variable with predictive capacity (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = [1.01, 1.09]). It should also be noted that there is a pattern of avoidance of alcohol stimuli in patients who drop out of treatment. Conclusion The results of this study suggest the need to delve into whether therapeutic strategies involving deeper emotional processing or avoidance strategies are more suitable for preventing relapse. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adherence; Alcohol; Attentional bias; Cocaine; Dot probe; Substance use disorders","adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; attention test; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; cocaine dependence; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; human; logistic regression analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; outcome variable; priority journal; response time; Spain; treatment retention; visual probe task","MINECO, Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","This study was funded by the grant “Estudio Longitudinal de una nueva batería neuropsicológica para la prevención de la recaída en pacientes con trastornos por consumo de alcohol y cocaína: estudio de precisión y evidencias de validez”, project PSI2016-79368-R, provided by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad .

Theoretical models suggest that attentional biases (AB) contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and PTSD; however, the influence of AB on clinical and heat pain sensitivity in chronic posttraumatic pain patients is unknown. This study investigated AB for linguistic pain-related stimuli and trauma-related stimuli, and clinical and thermal sensitivity in patients with chronic posttraumatic pain with and without PTSD. Materials and Methods: In total, 34 patients with chronic posttraumatic cervical pain performed the visual attentional probe task assessing patterns of selective attentional responding to trauma cues and to pain cues. The task used short (500 ms) and long (1250 ms) stimulus exposure durations to ensure sensitivity to both the orienting and maintenance of attention. Heat pain threshold was assessed at the nonpainful hand. Clinical pain intensity, psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and disability), and PTSD symptomatology were assessed with questionnaires. Results: The Pain/PTSD group (N=14) demonstrated increased clinical and heat pain sensitivity as well as psychological distress compared with the Pain/No-PTSD group (N=20; P<0.05). AB scores were significantly different between groups (P=0.04). Irrespective of stimulus exposure duration, the Pain/PTSD group demonstrated attentional bias away from trauma and pain cues (avoidance), whereas the Pain/No-PTSD group demonstrated attentional bias toward pain cues (vigilance). Attentional avoidance of pain cues was associated with increased pain intensity and heat pain sensitivity (P<0.02). Discussion: These results suggest that attentional avoidance is associated with increased chronic posttraumatic pain. The causal contribution of attentional avoidance to pain outcomes remains unclear. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the automaticity of this bias is under debate. In the present study, we aimed to test whether top-down (controlled) engagement and disengagement of attention toward threatening faces is associated with social anxiety. This was examined by testing the impact of a secondary working memory (WM) load on attentional biases. In a variation of the dot-probe task, participants’ attention was initially cued to the left or right of fixation before an upright face paired with an inverted face was presented (displaying a disgust or neutral expression), and participants responded to a subsequently presented probe. The task was performed under no-load, low-load (one-digit memory task), and high-load (six-digit memory task) conditions. Social anxiety was not found to be associated with delayed disengagement from threat. However, surprisingly, high social anxiety was associated with an engagement bias away from threat, whereas low social anxiety was associated with a bias toward threat. These results were unaffected by the WM load manipulation. This indicates that engagement with threatening facial expressions has minimal contributions from top-down mechanisms, since it is likely that orienting to facial expressions occurs relatively automatically. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Dot-probe; Selective attention; Social anxiety; Spatial attention; Working memory load",,"ARC, Australian Research Council; DE140101734, ARC, Division of Arctic Sciences","Acknowledgments This research was supported by an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Research Award (DE140101734) awarded to S.C.G.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028994469

In this eye-tracking study, we evaluated pain-related visual attention biases during image pair presentations in comparatively lower versus higher threat conditions. Methods: Gaze biases of healthy adults (47 women, 35 men) were assessed during image presentation phases standardized across (1) a modified visual dot-probe task featuring painful-neutral (pain) and neutral-neutral contrast (neutral) image pair blocks (lower threat context); and (2) an impending pain task wherein the same image pair blocks, respectively, cued potentially painful postoffset somatosensory stimuli (higher threat context) and its absence. Results: Across tasks, participants were more often oriented towards, gazed longer at, and fixated more times on pain images in pain block trials, although trait fear of pain was not related to any gaze biases. Critically, however, participants reported more state fear and displayed significantly fewer initial fixations, longer first and overall gaze durations, and more unique fixations on pain images when image pairs signalled possible postoffset pain stimulation. Conclusions: Results underscored stronger overall attention maintenance on visual pain cues in a higher threat (impending pain) context. Significance: Through considering gaze parameters during image presentation phases of dot-probe and impending pain tasks, possible effects of lower versus higher threat contexts on attention biases were elucidated. Participants reported more fear and gazed longer at painful than neutral images in the higher threat context whereby image pairs cued possible pain. © 2018 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.",,,,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042148582

These changes are supposed to persist even after prolonged abstinence. Several studies demonstrated that smoking cues selectively attract the attention of smokers, but empirical evidence for such an attentional bias among successful quitters is inconclusive. Here, we investigated whether attentional biases persist after smoking cessation. Thirty-eight former smokers, 34 current smokers, and 29 non-smokers participated in a single experimental session. We used three measures of attentional bias for smoking stimuli: A visual probe task with short (500. ms) and long (2000. ms) picture stimulus durations, and a modified Stroop task with smoking-related and neutral words. Former smokers and current smokers, as compared to non-smokers, showed an attentional bias in visual orienting to smoking pictures in the 500. ms condition of the visual probe task. The Stroop interference index of smoking words was negatively related to nicotine dependence in current smokers. Former smokers and mildly dependent smokers, as compared to non-smokers, showed increased interference by smoking words in the Stroop task. Neither current nor former smokers showed an attentional bias in maintained attention (2000. ms visual probe task). In conclusion, even after prolonged abstinence smoking cues retain incentive salience in former smokers, who differed from non-smokers on two attentional bias indices. Attentional biases in former smokers operate mainly in early involuntary rather than in controlled processing, and may represent a vulnerability factor for relapse. Therefore, smoking cessation programs should strengthen self-control abilities to prevent relapses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.","Abstinence; Attentional bias; Cue reactivity; Nicotine dependence; Smoking cessation",,"01EB0432","The present study was funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Grant number: 01EB0432 ) and by the Addiction Network NRW.

Both pain- and (nonpain) goal-related information attracts attention. An intriguing question is which attentional bias prevails when pain- and goal-related information co-occurs? Reduced attentional bias towards pain- and goal-related information was predicted when the other competing information was presented simultaneously. Moreover, trait attentional control was predicted to be associated with stronger attentional bias towards goal-related information particularly in the presence of pain-related information. Methods: Attentional competition between pain- and (nonpain) goal-related information was measured in ninety participants using a dot-probe task presenting two stimuli (pain-related, goal-related or neutral) simultaneously. Reaction time was the dependent variable. Dot-probe trials alternated with goal trials to induce a temporary goal. Trait attentional control was measured with the attentional control scale. Results: For pain-related neutral stimulus pairs, participants responded fastest when probes appeared on the same, compared to the opposite, location as the pain-related stimulus. For pain-goal-related stimulus pairs, responses were fastest when probes appeared on the same, compared to the opposite, location as the goal-related stimulus. Higher trait attentional control was associated with faster responding when probes appeared on the same, compared to the opposite, location as the goal-related stimulus. Unpredicted, this effect was irrespective of the co-occurring stimulus (neutral vs. pain-related). Conclusions: The findings suggest that the unintentional allocation of attention towards events related to a temporary (nonpain) goal prevails over attentional bias to events predicting pain. Trait attentional control predicts stronger attentional allocation towards events related to a temporary goal. Significance: These findings indicate that treatment interventions facilitating goal pursuit in patients with chronic pain are beneficial in reducing attentional biases towards pain-related events. © 2017 European Pain Federation - EFIC®",,"adult; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; fear; female; human; human experiment; male; pain; priority journal; response time; selective attention; visual stimulation","453-04-003; NWO, Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek","The contribution of Petra A.

Although research on muscle dysmorphia (MD), a body dysmorphic disorder subtype, has recently increased, the causes and mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unclear. Results from studies examining disorders associated with body image suggest the involvement of self-schema in biasing attention toward specific body information. The present study examined whether individuals at higher risk ofMDalso display attentional biases toward specific types of body images. Methods. The validated Chinese version of the Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale was used to distinguish men at higher and lower risk of MD. Sixty-five adult Chinese men at higher (HRMD, n D 33) and lower risk of MD (LRMD, n = 32) performed a visual probe task. Initially, an image of a bodybuilder with either larger or smaller musculature was presented on one side of a central point, with a neutral image of a car exterior presented on the other side along the horizontal plane for 2,000 ms. The paired images were removed, and a visual target (a dot) was displayed in the location of one of the previously shown images. Participants were asked to indicate the location of the target, and their eye movements were recorded during the entire visual presentation. Participant reaction time and three eye movement measurements (gaze direction, first saccade latency, and first fixation duration) were recorded for use in determining attentional bias. Results. The HRMD group revealed biases in orienting and maintaining their attention on images of bodybuilders with larger musculatures. Participants in this group consequently had a shorter reaction time in identifying the target that appeared at the location in which an image of a bodybuilder with a larger musculature had been previously displayed. They also directed their initial gaze more frequently, had shorter saccade latency, and had longer first fixation duration on images of bodybuilders with larger musculatures (all p < :0001). In comparison, the LRMD group had longer reaction times, slower attention orientation toward body images, and shorter fixation duration for images of bodybuilders with larger musculatures (all p < :0001), indicating weaker or mixed responses. Discussion. Adult Chinese men at higher risk of MD displayed biases in orienting and maintaining their visual attention toward images of bodybuilders with larger musculatures, and these biases facilitated their information processing. These results suggest that development ofMDmay be due in part to attentional biases associated with established negative self-schema of specific body information. These findings provide insight into understanding and identifying the cognitive characteristics of MD in an Asian population. © 2018 Jin et al.","Attentional bias; Body image; Eye movements; Muscle dysmorphia; Self-schema","adult; attentional bias; body builder; body image; Chinese; clinical article; controlled study; gaze; human; information processing; male; muscle; oculography; reaction time; saccadic eye movement; satisfaction; visual attention","2014, Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; 16JCYBJC29200, Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; 16JCYBJC29200, Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","This work was supported by the Tianjin Natural Science Foundation (No. 16JCYBJC29200), the Tianjin 131 Scholar Innovative Program (No. 2014) and the Tianjin Young Scholar Program (No.2014) in China.

Methods: A visual dot-probe task was used to assess attention towards pictures reflecting either a thin, normal, or obese female body shape. Pictures were presented in pairs; each pair depicted two different body shapes and were presented twice. Participant responses were compared across time and population. Results: Overall, the eating disorder patients responded more slowly than controls, F(1,63) = 20.32, p < .001. Both groups showed an attentional bias towards the larger of two body shapes, F(1,63) = 4.30, p = .04, and responded more quickly the second time they viewed the picture pairs, F(1,63) = 33.80, p < .001. Upon second viewing of picture pairs, the eating disorder patients had a larger decrease in reaction time (86 ms) than the control sample (33 ms) only when both pictures included extreme body shapes (thin and obese); the decrease in reaction time when one of the pictures included a normal body shape was the same across groups upon second viewing (eating disorder: 37 ms; control: 32 ms), F(1,63) = 9.32, p = .003. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals with eating disorders may be biased towards recall of dichotomous and/or extreme body shape images. While it remains unclear whether attentional and/or memorial bias is a risk, maintenance, or causal factor in eating disorders, future studies should employ longitudinal, prospective research designs to address these questions.

However, since many patients remain symptomatic post-treatment, there is a need for augmenting procedures. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the potential augmentation effect of attention bias modification (ABM) for CBGT. Methods: Fifty patients with SAD from three therapy groups were randomized to receive an 18-week standard CBGT with either ABM designed to shift attention away from threat (CBGT + ABM), or a placebo protocol not designed to modify threat-related attention (CBGT + placebo). Therapy groups took place in a large mental health center. Clinician and self-report measures of social anxiety and depression were acquired pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Attention bias was assessed at pre- and post-treatment. Results: Patients randomized to the CBGT + ABM group, relative to those randomized to the CBGT + placebo group, showed greater reductions in clinician-rated SAD symptoms post-treatment, with effects maintained at 3-month follow-up. Group differences were not evident for self-report or attention-bias measures, with similar reductions in both groups. Finally, reduction in attention bias did not mediate the association between group and reduction in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Structured Interview (LSAS) scores. Conclusions: This is the first RCT to examine the possible augmenting effect of ABM added to group-based cognitive–behavioral therapy for adult SAD. Training patients’ attention away from threat might augment the treatment response to standard CBGT in SAD, a possibility that could be further evaluated in large-scale RCTs.

This highlights the need to better understand the precise task conditions that facilitate the intended change in attention bias in order to realise the therapeutic potential of ABM procedures. Based on the observation that change in attentional bias occurs largely outside conscious awareness, the aim of the current study was to determine if an ABM procedure delivered under conditions likely to preclude explicit awareness of the experimental contingency, via the addition of a working memory load, would contribute to greater change in attentional bias. Methods Bias change was assessed among 122 participants in response to one of four ABM tasks given by the two experimental factors of ABM training procedure delivered either with or without working memory load, and training direction of either attend-negative or avoid-negative. Results Findings revealed that avoid-negative ABM procedure under working memory load resulted in significantly greater reductions in attentional bias compared to the equivalent no-load condition. Limitations The current findings will require replication with clinical samples to determine the utility of the current task for achieving emotional benefits.

A growing body of literature has examined ABM as a potentially efficacious intervention for reducing drinking and drinking-related cognitions in alcohol-dependent individuals as well as those at-risk of developing problem drinking habits. Methods: This study tested the effectiveness of a single session of visual probe-based ABM training in a cohort of 60 non-treatment-seeking young adult drinkers, with a focus on examining mechanisms underlying training efficacy. Participants were randomly assigned to a single session of active ABM training or a sham training condition in a laboratory setting. Measures of implicit drinking-related cognitions (alcohol Stroop and an Implicit Association Task) and attentional bias (AB; alcohol visual probe) were administered, and subjective alcohol craving was reported in response to in vivo alcohol cues. Results: Results showed that active ABM training, relative to sham, resulted in significant differences in measures of implicit alcohol-related cognition, alcohol-related AB, and self-reports of alcohol craving.

This systematic review synthesizes meta-analyses of CBM to determine whether CBM is effective, and what parameters most reliably evoke the process of CBM. Methods A systematic literature search resulted in twelve meta-analyses in total, from which the published effect sizes were extracted. Results Attention bias modification (ABM) shifted targeted biases in adults (ES = 0.24–1.16), was effective as a buffer to stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.33–0.77) and in symptom control (ES = 0.16–0.41). Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) modified targeted biases (ES = 0.52–0.81) but did not reliably reduce stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.01–0.24, p >.05). CBM consistently reduced anxiety symptoms, but effects on depressive symptomatology were less compelling. The long-term efficacy of CBM was only supported in addiction studies. Limitations The review included a single CBM-I only meta-analysis, and two meta-analyses with pooled reporting on ABM and CBM-I outcomes. Conclusions Overall, this synthesis shows CBM is effective in the short-term for anxiety in adults, and highlights some conditions under which CBM is most efficacious. Rather than debating the efficacy of CBM, future research should focus on developing procedures that more reliably induce bias modification and determining the most efficacious clinical applications. © 2017","Attentional Bias Modification (ABM); Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM); Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I); Systematic review","age; alcohol consumption; anxiety disorder; attention bias modification; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive bias modification; depression; eating disorder; follow up; human; meta analysis (topic); priority journal; Review; sex; smoking; stress",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026387625

Methods: By pooling patient-level datasets from randomized controlled trials of ABM that utilized a dot-probe training procedure, we assessed the impact of training ""dose"" on relevant outcomes among a pooled sample of 693 socially anxious adults. Results: A paradoxical effect of the number of training trials administered was observed for both posttraining social anxiety symptoms and behavioral attentional bias (AB) toward threat (the target mechanism of ABM). Studies administering a large (>1,280) number of training trials showed no benefit of ABM over control conditions, while those administering fewer training trials showed significant benefit for ABM in reducing social anxiety (P =.02). These moderating effects of dose were not better explained by other examined variables and previously identified moderators, including patient age, training setting (laboratory vs. home), or type of anxiety assessment (clinician vs. self-report).

Hence, the present study developed a novel methodology designed to examine the influence of stimulus movement on attentional vigilance to spider and non-spider stimuli. Eighty participants who varied in level of spider-fear completed an attentional-probe task that presented stimuli under two conditions. One condition presented stimuli that displayed an approaching movement, while the other condition presented stimuli that displayed a receding movement. Fear-linked heightened attentional vigilance was observed exclusively under the latter condition.

Recent research has shown that trial-to-trial variability may contain important information in such tasks. The current study aimed to determine whether trial-to-trial carryover effects in this task are related to PTSD symptoms. Dot probe tasks with attack-related scenes and angry faces were performed by 2 student samples. Interactions were tested with subclinical PTSD symptoms measured using the Trauma Screening Questionnaire. On the Scenes task, error rates increased after the probe had been presented on threat versus neutral cue locations. This effect increased with trauma symptoms. On the Faces task, symptoms were related to carryover effects on missed responses, which increased following probe-on-threat trials for current-probe-on-neutral trials only, and shifted from increasing to decreasing error rates over cue-stimulus interval. The results showed an overall carryover effect for attack scenes. Relationships with PTSD were found for both tasks. The precise relationships differed, suggesting either a general disruptive effect of attending or responding to threat, or a more cue-specific and time-dependent attend–threat association.

Gaining insight into how emotional expressions evolved as adaptations over the course of evolution can be achieved by making direct cross-species comparisons. To that extent, experimental paradigms that are suitable for investigating emotional processing across species need to be developed and evaluated. The emotional dot-probe task, which measures attention allocation toward emotional stimuli, has this potential. The task is implicit, and subjects need minimal training to perform the task successfully. Findings in nonhuman primates, although scarce, show that they, like humans, have an attentional bias toward emotional stimuli. However, the wide literature on human studies has shown that different factors can have important moderating effects on the results. Due to the large heterogeneity of this literature, these moderating effects often remain unnoticed. We here review this literature and show that subject characteristics and differences in experimental designs affect the results of the dot-probe task. We conclude with specific recommendations regarding these issues that are particularly relevant to take into consideration when applying this paradigm to study animals. © 2017, The Author(s).","Attention; Comparative; Cross-species; Dot-probe task; Emotion",,,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010739493

A newer proposal suggests that attentional bias is not a static phenomenon, but rather is characterized by fluctuations towards and away from threat. Here, we tested 28 combat Veterans with PTSD and 28 control Veterans on a dot probe task with negative-neutral word pairs. Combat-related words and generically negative words were presented in separate blocks. Replicating previous results, neither group showed a bias to attend towards or away from threat, but PTSD patients showed greater attentional bias variability (ABV), which correlated with symptom severity. However, the cognitive processes indexed by ABV are unclear. The present results indicated that ABV was strongly correlated with standard deviation at the reaction time (RT) level and with excessively long RTs (ex-Gaussian tau) related to cognitive failures.

Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 35 clinical MDD outpatients and matched HCs by applying a modified affective priming dot-probe paradigm, which consisted of various emotional facial expression pairs.

Infant studies have noted a normative pattern of preferential attention to salient cues, particularly angry faces. A parallel literature suggests that elevated attention bias to threat is associated with anxiety, particularly if coupled with temperamental risk. Examining the emerging relations between attention to threat and temperamental negative affect may help distinguish normative from at-risk patterns of attention. Infants (N = 145) ages 4 to 24 months (M = 12.93 months, SD = 5.57) completed an eye-tracking task modeled on the attention bias ""dot-probe"" task used with older children and adults. With age, infants spent greater time attending to emotion faces, particularly threat faces. All infants displayed slower latencies to fixate to incongruent versus congruent probes. Neither relation was moderated by temperament. Trial-by-trial analyses found that dwell time to the face was associated with latency to orient to subsequent probes, moderated by the infant's age and temperament. In young infants low in negative affect longer processing of angry faces was associated with faster subsequent fixation to probes; young infants high in negative affect displayed the opposite pattern at trend. Findings suggest that although age was directly associated with an emerging bias to threat, the impact of processing threat on subsequent orienting was associated with age and temperament. Early patterns of attention may shape how children respond to their environments, potentially via attention's gate-keeping role in framing a child's social world for processing. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Attention to threat; Eye-tracking; Infancy; Negative affect; Temperament",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030855951

Faster responses to probes co-located with the emotional stimulus are taken as evidence of attentional bias. Several studies indicate that such attentional bias measures have poor reliability, even though ERP studies show that people reliably attend to the emotional stimulus. This inconsistency might arise because the emotional stimulus captures attention briefly (as indicated by ERP), but cues appear for long enough that attention can be redistributed before the probe onset, causing RT measures of bias to vary across trials. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony between onset of the cues and onset of the probe) in a dot-probe task using angry and neutral faces. Across three experiments, the internal reliability of behavioural biases was significantly greater than zero when probes followed faces by 100 ms, but not when the SOA was 300, 500, or 900 ms. Thus, the initial capture of attention shows some level of consistency, but this diminishes quickly. Even at the shortest SOA internal reliability estimates were poor, and not sufficient to justify the use of the task as an index of individual differences in attentional bias. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","Attention; Attentional bias; Dot probe; Emotion; Reliability; Threat bias",,,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034589675

Research with adults has suggested that attentional control difficulties may underlie rumination, but questions remain about the nature of these processes. Furthermore, the relationship between attentional control and rumination in youth has received little empirical examination. In the present study, 92 youth (ages 9–14; 72% girls; 74% Caucasian) reported on their trait rumination and internalizing symptoms. They also completed a 1,500 ms emotional-faces dot-probe task while their eye movements were measured to examine overt visual attention with high temporal precision. Youth’s rumination was associated with greater dwell on emotional faces but not with initial orientation. These findings suggest that rumination is associated with increased attention to emotional information during the later stages of selective attention rather than earlier orienting to emotional cues.

As such, attention bias modification (ABM) was conceived as a treatment option where anxiety is alleviated through a computerized cognitive training regimen that reduces an individual's attentional bias to threat. Although ABM appears to be a promising treatment option for anxiety, the mechanism of action by which the treatment is effective is unknown. We hypothesize that effective ABM treatment is associated with neuroplasticity-related structural changes in an extended amygdala – prefrontal cortex network that can be detected with standard T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Literature regarding [1] effects of brain damage on attention bias, [2] functional neuroimaging of attention bias, [3] structural neuroimaging of attention bias, and [4] functional neuroimaging of ABM training all support the role of this network as the underlying mechanism of attention bias behavior and neuroplasticity-related changes in attentional bias. Additionally, we provide proof of principle pilot data that ABM training reduces MRI measures of gray matter volume in the basal forebrain/extended amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. Greater reduction in gray matter volume corresponds to greater reduction in attentional bias. In addition, level of pre-training bias appears to be a strong indicator of treatment outcome. In short, we provide converging evidence for the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying effective ABM training is reduced gray matter volume in an extended amygdala network. MRI-based measures of neuroplasticity in this network could be an important target outcome for the treatment of anxiety with ABM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; Attention bias; Attention bias modification; Cognitive bias modification; Cognitive training; Neuroplasticity","amygdala; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; Article; attention; attention bias modification; attentional bias; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; brain damage; brain function; brain size; emotion; forebrain; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; human; lateral prefrontal cortex; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; neuroimaging; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex; sensorimotor function; training; ventral medial prefrontal cortex; vision; visual cortex",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029583477

Following the guidelines of the PRISMA statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses), we here provide a systematic update on the evidence on food-related impulsivity in obese individuals, with and without BED, as well as normal-weight individuals. We separately analyzed potential group differences in the impulsivity components of reward sensitivity and rash-spontaneous behavior. Our search resulted in twenty experimental studies with high methodological quality. The synthesis of the latest evidence consolidates conclusions drawn in our initial systematic review that BED represents a distinct phenotype within the obesity spectrum that is characterized by increased impulsivity. Rash-spontaneous behavior in general, and specifically towards food, is increased in BED, while food-specific reward sensitivity is also increased in obese individuals without BED, but potentially to a lesser degree. A major next step for research entails the investigation of sub-domains and temporal components of inhibitory control in BED and obesity. Based on the evidence of impaired inhibitory control in BED, affected patients might profit from interventions that address impulsive behavior. © 2017 by the authors.","Binge eating disorder; Eating disorders; Food; Impulsivity; Inhibition; Obesity; Reward","accuracy; anterior cingulate; attentional bias; behavior disorder assessment; binge eating disorder; body mass; caloric intake; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electromyography; event related potential; eye movement disorder; face muscle; feeding behavior; Food Picture Rating Task; functional magnetic resonance imaging; GoNoGo task; human; impulsiveness; inhibition (psychology); magnetoencephalography; meta analysis; obesity; palatability; prefrontal cortex; Review; reward; stimulus response; Stop Signal Task; systematic review; task performance; ventral striatum; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; Visual Dot Probe task","2015/2","Acknowledgments: This work was supported by a grant from the INSTITUT DANONE Ernährung für Gesundheit e.V.

The current study, therefore, examined the presence and nature of attentional biases for facial expressions of emotion in children with and without a history of suicidal ideation (SI). Method Participants were 88 children (44 with a history of SI and 44 demographically and clinically matched controls without such history) recruited from the community. The average age of children was 9.26 years (44.3% female; 67.0% Caucasian). Children's history of SI was assessed via structured interviews with children and their parent. Attentional biases were assessed using a dot probe task and included fearful, happy, and sad facial stimuli and focused on eye tracking and reaction time indices of attentional bias. Results Children with a history of SI exhibited significantly greater gaze duration toward fearful faces. The findings appeared to be at least partially independent of children's history of major depression or anxiety disorders or their current depressive or anxious symptoms. Limitations The study is limited by its cross-sectional design, which precludes any causal conclusions regarding the role of attentional biases in future suicide risk. Conclusions Our results suggest that children with a history of SI exhibit biases in sustained attention toward socially-threatening facial expressions.

This study investigated whether children with asthma and anxiety disorders display attentional biases towards threatening stimuli, similar to what has been seen in children with anxiety disorders more generally. We also examined the relationships between attentional biases and anxiety symptomatology and asthma control for children with asthma. Ninety-three children, aged 8–13, took part in the study and were recruited into one of four conditions (asthma/anxiety, asthma, anxiety, control). Asthma was medically confirmed and anxiety was assessed through clinical interview. We used self- and parent-report questionnaires to measure child asthma (ATAQ) and anxiety (SCAS, CASI) variables. Participants completed a visual dot-probe task designed to measure attentional bias towards two types of stimuli: asthma related words and general threat words, as well as tasks to assess reading ability and attentional control. Results showed that attentional biases did not differ between the groups, although children with anxiety disorders displayed poorer attentional control. A significant correlation was found between poor asthma control and an attentional bias of asthma stimuli. While we found no evidence that anxiety disorders in children with asthma were associated with threat- or asthma-related attentional biases, preliminary evidence suggested that children with poor asthma control displayed biases towards asthma-specific stimuli. Future research is needed to explore whether these attentional biases are adaptive. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anxiety; Asthma; Attentional bias; Child",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008485763

These symptoms have been defined as Complex PTSD (CPTSD). The underlying attentional mechanisms of abnormal emotional processing and their relation to the clinical presentation of CPTSD are not well understood. A visual dot-probe paradigm involving pre-attentive (i.e., 500 ms) and attentive (i.e., 1500 ms) presentation rates of neutral versus emotional (i.e., angry, happy or sad) facial expressions was applied. Twenty-one maltreated CPTSD children were compared with twenty-six controls. The results are as follows: an attention bias away from threatening faces and an attentional bias towards sad faces were observed in maltreated CPTSD children during pre-attentive and attentive processing. Whereas the attentional bias away from angry faces was associated with social problems, the attentional bias towards sad faces was associated with depressive and withdrawn symptoms. Therefore, CPTSD children develop maladaptive negative cognitive styles, which may underlie not only social problems (by a cognitive avoidance of threatening stimuli) but also depressive symptoms (by a cognitive approach to sad stimuli).

Attentional orienting was assessed using an emotional faces (i.e., angry, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral) variant of the dot-probe task.

Logistic regression analyses showed that peer-nominated aggression was positively related to CU traits at low levels of attentional orienting to angry faces, whereas aggression was unrelated to CU traits at high levels of attentional orienting to angry faces. That is, peer-nominated aggression was greatest for youth high on CU traits who were not engaged by angry faces.

Experimental aggression studies typically measure only retaliation intensity, neglecting whether individuals want to confront the provocateur at all. To overcome this shortcoming of previous measures, we developed and validated the Fight-or-Escape paradigm (FOE). The FOE is a competitive reaction time (RT) task in which the winner can choose the volume of a sound blast to be directed at his/her opponent. Participants face two ostensible opponents who consistently select either high or low punishments. At the beginning of each trial, subjects are given the chance to avoid the encounter for a limited number of times. In a first experiment (n = 27, all women), we found that fear potentiation (FP) of the startle response was related to lower scores in a composite measure of aggression and avoidance against the provoking opponent. In a second experiment (n = 34, 13 men), we altered the paradigm such that participants faced the opponents in alternating rather than in random order. Participants completed the FOE as well as the Dot-Probe Task (DPT) and the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). Subjects with higher approach bias scores in the AAT avoided the provoking opponent less frequently. Hence, individuals with high threat reactivity and low approach motivation displayed more avoidant responses to provocation, whereas participants high in approach motivation were more likely to engage in aggressive interactions when provoked. The FOE is thus a promising laboratory measure of avoidance and aggression. © 2017 Beyer, Buades-Rotger, Claes and Krämer.","Aggression; Approach; Avoidance; Provocation; Retaliation","adult; article; avoidance behavior; clinical article; drug withdrawal; fear; female; human; male; motivation; provocation; punishment; reaction time; sound; startle reflex",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041951993

Affective context was instantiated by the presentation of negative versus neutral pictures before each trial, while repetition context was achieved via the presentation of the valenced pictures in either a blocked- or mixed-trial design. Results indicate that individuals with higher trait-anxiety levels were significantly more influenced by blocked presentations of negative affective information, leading to greater temporal fluctuations in attentional bias. Furthermore, our findings provide additional evidence that attentional bias is best conceptualised as dynamic and variable, and that an individual’s affective experience is one factor that regulates attentional bias dynamics.

In the present study, we examined the impact of a single session of attention bias modification, relative to a control task, on the neural correlates of response monitoring, including the ERN, correct response negativity (CRN), and their difference (i.e., the ERN – CRN or ΔERN). The final sample included 60 participants who first completed a flanker task to elicit the ERN and CRN, and were then randomly assigned to attention bias modification (n = 30) or a control task (n = 30). After completing the attention bias modification or control task, participants completed the same flanker task to again elicit the ERN and CRN. Among participants who completed attention bias modification training, the ERN, CRN, and ΔERN decreased from the pre- to post-training assessment. In contrast, in participants who completed the control task, the CRN, ERN, and ΔERN did not differ between the pre- and post-training assessment.

This study rigorously assessed attentional bias towards aversive and pleasant visual imagery associated with the presence or absence of a familiar service canine in 23 veterans with chronic military-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants were repeatedly tested with and without their service canines present on two tasks designed to elicit spontaneous visual attention to facial and scenic image pairs, respectively. Each stimulus contrasted an emotive image with a neutral image. Via eye-tracking, the difference in visual attention directed to each image was analyzed as a function of the valence contrast and presence/absence of the canine. Across both tasks, the presence of a familiar service canine attenuated the normative attentional bias towards aversive image content. In the facial task, presence of the service canine specifically reduced attention toward angry faces. In that task, as well, accumulated days with the service canine similarly modulated attention toward facial emotion. The results suggest that the presence of a familiar service canine is associated with attenuation of attentional bias to aversive stimuli in chronic military-service-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Questions remain regarding the generalization of such effects to other populations, their dependence on the familiarity, breed, and training of the canine, and on social context. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Selective attention was both considered as a dynamic process in time by investigating attentional bias scores at trial level and as a stable concept by investigating traditional attentional bias scores. In the first study we investigated the difference in selective attention between a group scoring high (n = 32) and low (n = 32) on contamination fear at a cross-sectional level. In the second study we administered a dot probe task before and after an experimental manipulation of OCD symptoms (n = 35) or a neutral induction (n = 33) in a convenience sample in order to determine the effects of state OCD symptoms on selective attention. In the current studies we found no evidence for either a trait-related presence of attention bias nor for influences of experimentally induced contamination fear. Furthermore, baseline selective attention did not predict symptoms after an OCD symptom induction. These results point to either a more complex relationship between OCD and selective attention than an unidirectional relationship or suggest that selective attention may not be as important for obsessive-compulsive disorders as it is for anxiety disorders. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Attentional bias; Contamination fear; Dot probe; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; OCD; Selective attention","adult; Article; attention test; attentional bias; attentional bias variability; attentional interference; contamination fear; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dot probe task; fear; female; human; male; obsessive compulsive disorder; priority journal; selective attention","B/13811/01, Universiteit Gent; AXA Research Fund; Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds","Funding for this study was provided by a Grant of the Special Research Fund ( BOF ) of Ghent University awarded to Laura De Putter ( B/13811/01 ).

Methods Healthy middle-aged dizygotic twins (N = 42) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): 22 twins had a co-twin history of depression (high-risk) and 20 were without co-twin history of depression (low-risk). During fMRI, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. After the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping. Results Unexpectedly, high-risk twins showed reduced fear vigilance and lower recognition of fear and happiness relative to low-risk twins. During face processing in the scanner, high-risk twins displayed distinct negative functional coupling between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate. This was accompanied by greater fear-specific fronto-temporal response and reduced fronto-occipital response to all emotional faces relative to baseline. The risk groups showed no differences in mood, subjective state or coping. Conclusions Less susceptibility to fearful faces and negative cortico-limbic coupling during emotional face processing may reflect neurocognitive compensatory mechanisms in middle-aged dizygotic twins who remain healthy despite their familial risk of depression.

However, the mechanisms underlying effective ABM delivery are not well understood, with awareness of the training contingency suggested as one possible factor contributing to ABM efficacy. Here, 45 high-anxious participants were trained to divert attention away from threat in two ABM sessions. They were randomly assigned to one of three training protocols: an implicit protocol, comprising two standard implicit ABM training sessions; an explicit protocol, comprising two sessions with explicit instruction as to the attention training contingency; and an implicit-explicit protocol, in which participants were not informed of the training contingency in the first ABM session and informed of it at the start of the second session. We examined learning processes and stress reactivity following a stress-induction task. Results indicate that relative to implicit instructions, explicit instructions led to stronger learning during the first training session. Following rest, the explicit and implicit groups exhibited consolidation-related improvement in performance, whereas no such improvement was noted for the implicit-explicit group. Finally, although stress reactivity was reduced after training, contingency awareness did not yield a differential effect on stress reactivity measured using both self-reports and skin conductance, within and across sessions. These results suggest that explicit ABM administration leads to greater initial learning during the training protocol while not differing from standard implicit administration in terms of off-line learning and stress reactivity. © 2017","anxiety; attentional training; explicit information; learning; stress reactivity","anxiety; attentional bias; awareness; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; human; learning; randomized controlled trial; rest; self report; skin conductance; stress",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017313507

However, as far as we know the effect of these interventions has not been investigated so far by means of a quantitative meta-analysis. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on AAT/ABM interventions for attention to and approach of appetitive food stimuli. A random-effects model was used for pooling the effect sizes, which were calculated for bias scores and food consumption/craving (FC/C) outcomes at post-intervention, and we also examined risk of bias, publication bias, and possible other moderators. Results: We included 15 RCTs, of which seven RCTs employed an AAT intervention and eight RCTs employed an ABM intervention. At postintervention, there were significant effects sizes favoring CBM in terms of bias scores (g = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.79) and FC/C outcomes (g = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.38). The type of bias intervention and the type of control group were significant moderators of the effect size for the bias scores outcome. The risk of bias was uncertain in most of the trials and we found no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that CBM interventions are showing promise in the overweight/obese and maladaptive eating domains. However, the quality of the RCTs entails a more cautious interpretation of these effect sizes.

It was tested whether biases could be increased and decreased by means of a modified dot-probe paradigm, how long such bias modification persisted, and whether this affected subjective food craving. Participants were randomly assigned to a bias enhancement (attend to food stimulus) group or to a bias reduction (avoid food stimulus) group. Food-related attentional bias was found to be successfully reduced in the bias-reduction group, and effects persisted briefly.

The goal of the study was to explore the moderating role of executive control and readiness to change on the relationship between alcohol use and cognitive biases in light and problematic drinkers with and without mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID). Method: Participants (N = 112) performed the visual dot probe task to measure the strength of the cognitive biases. Executive control was measured using two computerised tasks for working memory capacity (Corsi block-tapping task) and inhibitory control (Go/No-go task). Readiness to change was measured using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire. Results: No cognitive biases or executive dysfunctions were found in problematic drinkers. Working memory capacity and inhibitory control were impaired among individuals with MBID, irrespective of severity of alcohol use-related problems. Executive control and readiness to change did not moderate the relationship between alcohol use and cognitive biases.

FXS is caused by a silencing of the FMR1 gene that results in a loss or absence of the gene's protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein. The phenotype of FXS is consistently associated with heightened anxiety, although no previous study has investigated attentional bias toward threat, a hallmark of anxiety disorders, in individuals with FXS. Methods The current study employed a passive-viewing eye-tracking version of the dot probe task to investigate attentional biases toward emotional faces in young children with FXS (n = 47) and without FXS (n = 94). Results We found that the FXS group showed a significantly greater bias toward threatening emotions than toward positive emotions. This threat specificity was not seen in either a mental age–matched group or a chronological age–matched group of typically developing children. Unlike the typically developing groups, the FXS group showed no bias toward positive emotion. Conclusions The current study shows that children with FXS have a significant bias toward threatening information, an attentional profile that has been linked with anxiety. It also supports the use of eye-tracking methodology to index neural and attentional responses in young children with FXS. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry","Anxiety; Attention; Emotion; Eye tracking; Fragile X syndrome; Threat processing","age; Article; attentional bias; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; child; child behavior; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; eye tracking; facial recognition; female; fragile X syndrome; human; infant; latent period; male; mental task; priority journal; threat","Novartis; SMR, National Institutes of Health; R01 HD056031, National Institutes of Health; Roche","This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Health (Grant No. R01 HD056031 to SMR).

The objective of the present study was to examine whether e-cigarette cues capture and hold smokers’ and former smokers’ attention and whether the attentional focus is associated with subsequent craving for tobacco cigarettes. It was also examined whether device type (cigalike or mod) moderated this relationship. Participants (46 current daily smokers, 38 former smokers, 48 non-smokers) were randomly assigned to a device type condition in which their eye-movements were assessed while completing a visual probe task. Craving was assessed before and after the task. Smokers, but not former or non-smokers, maintained their gaze longer on e-cigarette than on neutral pictures (p = 0.004). No difference in dwell time was found between device type. None of the smoking status groups showed faster initial fixations or faster reaction times to e-cigarette compared with neutral cues. Baseline craving was associated with dwell time on e-cigarette cues (p = 0.004). Longer dwell time on e-cigarette cues was associated with more favorable attitudes towards e-cigarettes.

This double-blind functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated for the first time whether electroconvulsive therapy modulates negative neurocognitive bias in major depressive disorder. Patients with major depressive disorder were randomised to one active (n=15) or sham electroconvulsive therapy (n=12). The following day they underwent whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T while viewing emotional faces and performed facial expression recognition and dot-probe tasks. A single electroconvulsive therapy session had no effect on amygdala response to emotional faces. Whole-brain analysis revealed no effects of electroconvulsive therapy versus sham therapy after family-wise error correction at the cluster level, using a cluster-forming threshold of Z>3.1 (p<0.001) to secure family-wise error <5%. Groups showed no differences in behavioural measures, mood and medication. Exploratory cluster-corrected whole-brain analysis (Z>2.3; p<0.01) revealed electroconvulsive therapy-induced changes in parahippocampal and superior frontal responses to fearful versus happy faces as well as in fear-specific functional connectivity between amygdala and occipito-temporal regions. Across all patients, greater fear-specific amygdala - occipital coupling correlated with lower fear vigilance. Despite no statistically significant shift in neural response to faces after a single electroconvulsive therapy session, the observed trend changes after a single electroconvulsive therapy session point to an early shift in emotional processing that may contribute to antidepressant effects of electroconvulsive therapy. © British Association for Psychopharmacology.","Electroconvulsive therapy; functional magnetic resonance imaging; major depressive disorder; negative bias","antidepressant agent; adult; alertness; antidepressant activity; Article; brain analysis; central nucleus (amygdala); clinical article; cluster analysis; cognitive bias; controlled study; double blind procedure; electroconvulsive therapy; emotion; facial expression; facial recognition; facies; fear; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; human; major depression; male; masking; mental task; nerve potential; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parahippocampal gyrus; parallel design; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sham procedure; stimulus response; superior frontal gyrus","Allergan; 2016, Elsass Fonden; UCB; Sunovion; Grant Foundation; Janssen Biotech; Genzyme; Janssen Biotech; Janssen Biotech; Shire; Heart Rhythm Society; GlaxoSmithKline foundation; Lundbeckfonden; AstraZeneca; Købmand I Odense Johan og Hanne Weimann Født Seedorffs Legat; Genzyme; Lundbeckfonden; Allergan; R32-A2904, Lundbeckfonden","The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: KWM reports having received consultancy fees from Lundbeck and Allergan in the past three years.

Although it is well established that humans show delays in disengaging their attention from conventional affective stimuli, it is unknown whether contextually acquired affective meaning similarly impacts attention. We examined attentional disengagement following pairs of neutral or slightly ambiguous words that in combination could evoke sex, violence or neutral associations. Study 1 demonstrated slower disengagement following words that conveyed sex or violence associations compared to words that conveyed neutral associations. This pattern was only present for participants who were aware of sex or violence associations. Study 2 replicated these results in a large sample, but only for sex associations. Study 3 replicated the effect while instructing participants explicitly to expect sex and violence associations. Finally, two control studies countered reasonable alternative explanations for our findings. Together, these studies show that contextually driven affective associations can arise quickly with the potential to influence attentional processes. These findings are consistent with theoretical models of emotion and language that highlight the importance of context in the generation of affective meaning. © 2016 The Author(s).

Accumulated data from laboratory studies show that positive and negative interpretation styles with accompanying changes in mood can be induced through cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigms. Despite the therapeutic potential of positive training effects, few studies have explored training paradigms administered via smartphones. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of three different types of training programmes (cognitive bias modification-attention, CBM-A; cognitive bias modification-interpretation, CBM-I; attention and interpretation modification, AIM) administered via smart-phones by using a control condition (CC). Methods: Seventy-six undergraduate participants with high social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS ≥ 30) were randomly assigned to four groups: CBM-A (n = 20), CBM-I (n = 20), AIM (n = 16), and CC (n = 20). Results: The results showed that the effects of CBM training, CBM-I training, or AIM training vs. CC for attention yielded no significant differences in dot-probe attention bias scores. The CBM-I group showed significantly less threat interpretation and more benign interpretation than the CC group on interpretation bias scores.

Despite the fact that addiction is often linked to specific products and systematic purchase behaviors, no studies focused directly on the existence of bias evoked by brands. Smokers are characterized by high levels of brand loyalty and everyday contact with cigarette packaging. Using the incentive-salience mechanism as a theoretical framework, we hypothesized that this group might exhibit a bias toward the preferred cigarette brand. In our study, a group of smokers (N = 40) performed a dot probe task while their eye movements were recorded. In every trial a pair of pictures was presented – each of them showed a single cigarette pack. The visual properties of stimuli were carefully controlled, so branding information was the key factor affecting subjects' reactions. For each participant, we compared gaze behavior related to the preferred vs. other brands. The analyses revealed no attentional bias in the early, orienting phase of the stimulus processing and strong differences in maintenance and disengagement. Participants spent more time looking at the preferred cigarettes and saccades starting at the preferred brand location had longer latencies. In sum, our data shows that attentional bias toward brands might be found in situations not involving choice or decision making. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of formation and maintenance of attentional biases to stimuli of personal relevance and might serve as a first step toward developing new attitude measurement techniques. © 2017 Domaradzka and Bielecki.","Attentional bias; Brand preference; Dot probe task; Eye-tracking; Smoking",,"2011/01/N/HS6/04071, NCN, Narodowe Centrum Nauki","This research was supported by National Science Centre Poland Grant 2011/01/N/HS6/04071.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027252898

Imaging studies suggest the engagement of fronto-limbic regions like amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and lateral prefrontal cortex, is related to negatively biased attention. However, neural correlates of attentional bias for negative stimuli in individuals with subthreshold depression (SubD), that is individuals who have clinically relevant depressive symptoms but do not fulfill the criteria for MDD, remain unclear. Here, we used functional neuroimaging and the dot-probe task to elucidate the neural substrates of negatively biased attention among individuals with SubD. Behavioral results found that individuals with SubD allocated more attention toward negative stimuli relative to neutral stimuli, which were not observed among non-depressed controls (NCs). Imaging results found greater amygdala and rostral ACC activity in attentional bias toward negative stimuli among participants with SubD compared to NCs; Additionally, participants with SubD showed reduced engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with NCs in the attentional processing of negative stimuli.

Recent studies have shown that predictiveness-driven attention can operate rapidly and in an automatic way to exploit known relationships. The corresponding characteristics of uncertainty-driven attention, on the other hand, remain unexplored. In two experiments we examined whether both predictiveness and uncertainty modulate attentional processing in an adaptation of the dot probe task. This task provides a measure of automatic orientation to cues during associative learning. The stimulus onset asynchrony of the probe display was manipulated in order to explore temporal characteristics of predictiveness- and uncertainty-driven attentional effects. Results showed that the predictive status of cues determined selective attention, with faster attentional capture to predictive than to non-predictive cues. In contrast, the level of uncertainty slowed down responses to the probe regardless of the predictive status of the cues. Both predictiveness- and uncertainty-driven attentional effects were very rapid (at 250 ms from cue onset) and were automatically activated. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Associative learning; Attention; Dot probe; Predictiveness; Uncertainty","analysis of variance; association; attentional bias; female; human; learning; male; photostimulation; physiology; predictive value; reaction time; student; uncertainty; university; vision; Analysis of Variance; Association Learning; Attentional Bias; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Predictive Value of Tests; Reaction Time; Students; Uncertainty; Universities; Visual Perception","DP160103063, ARC, Australian Research Council; FT100100260, ARC, Division of Arctic Sciences","This work was supported by Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects [grant number DP140103268], [grant number DP160103063].

ABMT may target rapid, implicit threat reactions, whereas CBT may target slowly deployed threat responses. The authors used amygdala-based connectivity during a threat-attention task and a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate potential complementary features of these treatments in pediatric anxiety disorders. Method: Prior to treatment, youths (8-17 years old) with anxiety disorders (N=54), as well as healthy comparison youths (N=51), performed a threat-attention task during functional MRI acquisition. Task-related amygdala-based functional connectivity was assessed. Patients with and without imaging data (N=85) were then randomly assigned to receive CBT paired with either active or placebo ABMT. Clinical response was evaluated, and pretreatment amygdalabased connectivity profiles were compared among patients with varying levels of clinical response. Results: Compared with theCBT plus placebo ABMTgroup, the CBT plus active ABMT group exhibited less severe anxiety after treatment. The patient and healthy comparison groups differed in amygdala-insula connectivity during the threat-attention task. Patients whose connectivity profiles were most different from those of the healthy comparison group exhibited the poorest response to treatment, particularly those who received CBT plus placebo ABMT. Conclusions: The study provides evidence of enhanced clinical effects for patients receiving active ABMT. Moreover, ABMT appears to be most effective for patients with abnormal amygdala-insula connectivity. ABMTmay target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala-insula connectivity that are not targeted by CBT alone. This may explain the observation of enhanced clinical response to CBT plus active ABMT.",,"fluoxetine; adolescent; amygdala; anxiety disorder; Article; attention bias modification therapy; attentional bias; behavior therapy; child; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; disease severity; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; generalized anxiety disorder; human; insula; major clinical study; major depression; male; obsessive compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; school child; separation anxiety; social phobia; treatment response; Anxiety Disorders; arousal; attentional bias; behavior therapy; brain cortex; cognitive therapy; comparative study; multimodality cancer therapy; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; psychology; reference value; Adolescent; Amygdala; Anxiety Disorders; Arousal; Attentional Bias; Behavior Therapy; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Cognitive Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Prognosis; Reference Values",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026764241

Unfortunately, in the studies carried out to date, the assessment procedures used by researchers to assess such attentional selectivity have either been methodologically limited or methodologically flawed. Hence, the validity of the hypothesis has remained indeterminate. To overcome the problems associated with attentional assessment procedures used in previous studies, and so shed light on the attentional basis of positive affectivity, we employed an appropriate variant of the attentional probe task. Our findings show that participants high in positive affectivity displayed greater relative attention to positive information compared to neutral information, than was the case for their low positive affectivity counterparts.

Theoretical approaches often carry the implicit assumption that various attentional bias measures tap into the same underlying construct, but attention itself is not a unitary mechanism. Most attentional bias tasks-such as the dot probe (DP)-index spatial attention, neglecting other potential attention mechanisms. We compared the DP with emotion-induced blindness (EIB), which appears to be mechanistically distinct, and examined the degree to which these tasks predicted (a) negative affect, (b) persistent negative thought (i.e., worry, rumination), and (c) each other. The 2 tasks did not predict each other, and they uniquely accounted for negative affect in a regression analysis. The relationship between EIB and negative affect was mediated by persistent negative thought, whereas that between the DP and negative affect was not, suggesting that EIB may be more intimately linked than spatial attention with persistent negative thought. Experiment 2 revealed EIB to have a favorable test-retest reliability.

In keeping with recent theory and research, it was hypothesized that we would identify a pattern of attentional bias characterized by enhanced initial vigilance followed by avoidance of pain-related stimuli. Method: Undergraduate students were randomized to a rumination condition, which received threat-inducing information about the cold pressor task, or a distraction condition. Using the dot probe task, attentional biases to sensory and affective pain words were assessed at two presentation intervals (500 and 1250 ms). Results: Those in the rumination condition did not show differences in attentional biases compared to the control group, however, they did respond more quickly to pain congruent trials compared to neutral/neutral trials when affective pain words were presented for 500 ms. In addition, those in the rumination group responded more slowly in congruent trials to neutral/neutral trials than affective/neutral trials indicating avoidance at 1250 ms. Although those in the rumination condition exhibited higher levels of distress and reported higher levels of pain when they withdrew their hands from the cold pressor task, the congruency biases did not predict these results. Conclusion: These results suggest that experimentally manipulating rumination changes attentional processes consistent with the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis. Significance: The rumination manipulation led to increased worry about pain and induced to an attentional pattern of vigilance-avoidance for affective pain words. The induction also led to more distress and pain. Rumination and worry appear to increase unhelpful patterns of attention and could be an appropriate focus of intervention. © 2017 European Pain Federation - EFIC®",,"adolescent; adult; alertness; Article; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; catastrophizing; controlled study; correlational study; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; distress syndrome; female; human; male; normal human; outcome assessment; pain; pain assessment; pain catastrophizing scale; patient worry; Penn State Worry Questionnaire; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; priority journal; rumination condition; rumination inventory; self report; undergraduate student; anxiety; attention; pain; pain measurement; physiology; psychology; statistical bias; student; wakefulness; Anxiety; Attention; Bias; Humans; Pain; Pain Measurement; Students; Wakefulness","DP120103919, ARC, Australian Research Council","This study was funded by an Australian Research Council grant (DP120103919).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014658144

Accumulating evidence suggests that an attentional bias toward death/threat-related stimuli exists in bereaved individuals experiencing prolonged grief (PG). Measuring for different processing may reflect different cognitive characteristics. Therefore, this study sought to compare information-processing biases in Chinese individuals with high versus low levels of PG symptomatology at supraliminal and subliminal levels, respectively. Method: A 2 (grief level) × 2 (consciousness level) × 2 (word type) three-factor mixed design with supraliminal and subliminal tasks was utilized in the current study. Based on their Prolonged Grief Questionnaire-13 (PG-13) scores, 38 participants were included in the low-PG group, and 34 individuals were included in the high-PG group. All the participants completed a dot-probe task in which they were primed with death-related and life-related words paired with neutral stimuli. Results: High-PG individuals were slower in reacting to the death-related information in both supraliminal and subliminal tasks. After controlling for other symptoms in the backward deletion regression, PG-13 scores significantly predicted the avoidance tendency to death-related words in the supraliminal task, while anxiety was the best predictor of turning one's vision away from death-related stimuli in the subliminal trials. Conclusion: The results suggested that high PG is associated with a tendency to avoid death-related words. Future research is needed to explore interventions that address the avoidance of death-related stimuli among individuals with elevated, or diagnosable, levels of PG. © 2017 Yu, Tang, Wang, Xiang, Yu, Xu, Wang and Prigerson.","Attentional bias; Avoidant tendency; Bereavement; Dot-probe task; Prolonged grief",,"16ZDA233","This study was supported by the National Social Sciences Fund (Grant no. 16ZDA233).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025455662

This review examines 34 studies assessing effects of multisession-ABM on both anxiety and AB in high-anxious individuals. Methods include ABM-threat-avoidance (promoting attention-orienting away from threat), ABM-positive-search (promoting explicit, goal-directed attention-search for positive/nonthreat targets among negative/threat distractors), and comparison conditions (e.g., control-attention training combining threat-cue exposure and attention-task practice without AB-modification). Findings indicate anxiety reduction often occurs during both ABM-threat-avoidance and control-attention training; anxiety reduction is not consistently accompanied by AB reduction; anxious individuals often show no pretraining AB in orienting toward threat; and ABM-positive-search training appears promising in reducing anxiety. Methodological and theoretical issues are discussed concerning ABM paradigms, comparison conditions, and AB assessment.

One such treatment approach, attention bias modification training (ABMT), targets the anxiety-related threat bias, a disruption in attention to and neural processing of threat-related information. It remains unclear, however, whether reducing treatment barriers via mobile delivery of ABMT is effective and whether ABMT efficacy varies depending on individual differences in neural processing of threat. The present study tested whether mobile, gamified ABMT reduced prenatal threat bias, anxiety and stress, and whether ABMT efficacy varied with individual differences in neural responses to threat. Participants were 29 women in their 19th–29th week of pregnancy, randomized to four weeks of an ABMT or placebo training (PT) version of the mobile app using a double-blind design. Self-report of anxiety, depression, and stress were obtained; salivary cortisol was collected at home and in lab in response to stressors to index biological stress reactivity. Threat bias was measured using a computerized attention assay during which EEG was recorded to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to threat cues. Results showed lower levels of lab cortisol following ABMT versus PT. Although the main effect of ABMT on subjective anxiety was not significant, the magnitude of cortisol reduction was correlated with lower levels of subjective anxiety and threat bias. Those receiving ABMT also reported less anxiety when showing smaller ERPs to threat (P1, P2) prior to training, but, conversely reported more anxiety when showing larger ERPs to threat. Use of gamified, mobile ABMT reduced biobehavioral indices of prenatal stress and anxiety, but effects on anxiety varied with individual differences in cortisol response and neurocognitive indices of early attention to threat. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"hydrocortisone; placebo; adult; anxiety; area under the curve; Article; attention bias modification training; attentional bias; behavioral science; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; disease association; double blind procedure; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; event related potential; female; gestational age; human; mobile application; physiological stress; pilot study; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal stress; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; saliva level; self report; stress reactivity; threat; training",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020050473

Researchers are collecting data supporting the idea that it is possible to modify the cognitive biases and the clinical symptoms as well. The present paper focuses on the modification of attentional bias and symptoms in both anxiety disorders and depression. Method After a brief recall about the nature of attentional biases in anxiety and depression disorders, the article offers a synthetic review of the recent literature on attentional bias modification (ABM) in these mental disorders. First, it explains and debates the methodology mostly employed in this domain. Secondly, it presents the main results with a critical viewpoint especially on the therapeutic interests of these findings by answering a series of questions relevant for the clinical practice. Results In anxiety disorders, the attentional bias selectively favors information that is the most threatening for the trouble. The attentional bias in depression is characterized by a preference toward negative information and is also likely to have an absence of bias for positive information compared to healthy subjects. The attentional bias is most often modified using the so-called dot probe task. However, poor psychometric properties have been now repetitively reported. What are the effects of attentional bias modification on anxiety disorders? The research showed that only one session of ABM is sufficient to modify the bias toward threat and to reduce the emotional vulnerability when people are exposed to stressful situations. These findings have been reported for different anxiety disorders and in adults, adolescents and children. Can the attentional bias modification be envisaged as a therapeutic intervention of anxiety disorders? To answer to this question, patients have been exposed to several ABM sessions. Furthermore, a variety of outcomes measures (subjective, behavioural and physiological) have been taken. The researchers reported a modification of the attentional bias and an improvement of a variety of clinical symptoms. The results of one meta-analysis revealed that more ABM sessions lead to a more extended bias modification. However, another meta-analysis failed to show that a more extended bias modification leads to a greater improvement of the clinical symptoms. This report puts forward the need to enhance our knowledge on the causal relationship between the attentional bias and clinical symptoms. More recently, researchers have developed ABM training at home or via smartphone but the results are mitigated. Is it useful to combine the modification of attentional bias to another clinical intervention to treat anxiety disorders? A few studies have been conducted and even if some of them reported positive findings, overall, the results are reserved. Further, given the number of dropout reported, the effectiveness of the current ABM paradigm in a real-world setting is questionable. What are the effects of attentional bias modification on depression? A few small studies on ABM for depression have been published. Researchers found that ABM sessions lead to a reduced bias for negative stimuli but it is likely that this is only for individuals suffering from a low level of depression. The research on ABM in depression seems to be more successful in the use of ABM as a means to prevent the depressive relapse. Conclusion The ABM paradigm seems to be efficient to treat anxiety disorders even if its capacity to improve the clinical symptoms remains small. In depression, its efficiency remains to be established. So, researchers are now trying to alleviate the use of the current ABM paradigm or to innovate new paradigms to make ABM more exploitable in the context of a therapeutic treatment. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Anxiety; Attention; Cognitive bias; Cognitive therapy; Critical study; Depression; Literature review","anxiety disorder; Article; attentional bias; attentional bias modification; cognitive therapy; depression; human; relapse; therapy effect; treatment outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962863093

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to establish dimensionally and neuroscience-based descriptions of psychopathology that may inform better classification and treatment approaches. The current investigation sought to determine the latent variables underlying positive and negative valence processing in terms of symptoms and behavioral units of analysis. Method As part of an ongoing study, individuals with mood and anxiety problems were recruited largely from primary care clinics at UCLA (n=62) and UCSD (n=58). These participants underwent a comprehensive symptomatic and behavioral assessment. An implicit approach avoidance task and a modified dot probe detection task were used to measure positive and negative valence processing. Results Principal components analysis with varimax rotation identified four symptom components, three behavioral components for the dot probe task, and two behavioral components for the implicit approach avoidance task. These components yielded two meta-components consisting of: negative valence symptoms, negative approach bias, and high sustained, selective attention; and positive valence symptoms, positive approach bias, and slow selective or sustained attention. The components did not differ between males and females, nor by age or medication status. Limitations The limitations are: (1) relatively small sample, (2) exploratory analysis strategy, (3) no test/re-test data, (4) no neural circuit analysis, and (5) limited reliability of behavioral data. Conclusions These preliminary data show that positive and negative valence processing domains load on independent dimensions. Taken together, multi-level assessment approaches combined with advanced statistical analyses may help to identify distinct positive and negative valence processes within a clinical population that cut across traditional diagnostic categories. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety disorders; Mood disorders; Negative valence processing; Positive valence processing; Principal components analysis; Research domain criteria","Acceptance Safety Escape Avoidance Scale; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; avoidance behavior; Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Scale; comorbidity; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; Implicit Approach Avoidance Task; major clinical study; male; mental development; mental disease assessment; modified probe detection task; Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire Short Form; mood disorder; negative valence processing; neurobiology; Personality Inventory for DSM 5; Positive and Negative Affective Schedule Trait; positive valence processing; primary medical care; principal component analysis; priority journal; selective attention; self report; Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire; structural equation modeling; task performance; Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale; varimax rotation; World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; anxiety disorder; attention; emotion; mental disease; mood disorder; psychology; statistical bias; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Bias; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mood Disorders; Principal Component Analysis; Psychopathology",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010496557

In addition, a large body of research has demonstrated that exposure to alcohol cues can elicit powerful alcohol cravings. Little is known, however, about the possible relationship between attentional bias and cue-induced cravings, and even less is known about these processes in social drinkers without a personal history of AUDs. The goal of this study was to examine the possibility that attentional biases toward alcohol-related stimuli would predict elevated cue-induced alcohol craving in this population. Young adult social drinkers (N = 30, Mean age = 22.8 ± 1.9, 61% female) recruited from an urban university population completed a visual dot probe task in which they were presented with alcohol and neutral stimulus pictures that were immediately followed by a visual probe replacing one of the pictures. Attentional bias was measured by calculating reaction times to probes that replaced alcohol stimuli vs. neutral stimuli. Participants then completed a classic alcohol cue-exposure task and reported cravings immediately before and after alcohol and neutral cue-exposures. Not surprisingly, exposure to alcohol cues elicited significant cravings. Consistent with the study hypothesis, larger attentional biases toward alcohol stimuli predicted higher levels of alcohol craving. Findings demonstrate that heightened attention to alcohol stimuli can significantly impact motivation to consume in healthy young adults, and suggest a possible pathway linking cognitive processes early in the drinking trajectory to the later development of AUDs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol; Attentional bias; Craving; Cue","alcohol; adult; alcoholism; Article; attentional bias; clinical article; craving; drinking behavior; female; human; male; questionnaire; response time; task performance; university student; visual stimulation; young adult; association; college drinking; psychology; statistics and numerical data; student; university; Adult; Alcohol Drinking in College; Attentional Bias; Craving; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Students; Universities; Young Adult","NIAAA, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism","Financial support was provided by grant # R21AA020955 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (Erblich, Principal Investigator).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012309110

Research using this task has found inconsistent patterns of appearance-related attentional biases in women. This study examined the effects of a novel priming variation of the DPT, which incorporated additional cues into each trial of the task, on measurement of such biases. The study also examined associations between these biases and body image, a component of eating disorder symptomatology. A convenience sample of women from the general community (N = 103) completed body image measures online and attended a laboratory session to complete one of four DPTs: (1) an appearance-cued DPT containing images of thin-ideal models between each trial; (2) neutral-cued DPT containing images of forests; (3) time-delayed DPT controlling for time in place of an image; or (4) typical DPT containing only word stimuli. Women who completed the appearance-cued DPT demonstrated a stronger attentional bias for positive, but not negative, appearance words than women who completed the other DPT versions. Furthermore, for the appearance-cued and time-delayed DPTs, this bias correlated with poorer body image across several indicators (appearance evaluation, body dissatisfaction, self-evaluative salience of appearance, and state body satisfaction). Although it was unexpected that no attentional bias for negative-appearance words was found, the attentional bias for positive-appearance words may suggest that effects were driven by the ego-threat of positive-appearance words.

Method 38 Younger adults and 38 older adults were administered a battery of cognitive control and trait and state anxiety measures, and completed a dot-probe task to assess attention bias, during which reaction time and fixation duration (using eye-tracking) were recorded for negative and neutral social (a salient threat domain for younger adults) and physical (a salient threat domain for older adults) stimuli. Results Mixed-effects models demonstrated that older adults were faster to react to dot-probe trials when the probe appeared in the place of negative (vs. neutral) physical stimuli, but displayed no difference in reaction time for social stimuli. Also, older (vs. younger) adults with lower levels of cognitive control were less negatively biased in their visual fixation to social stimuli. A negative reaction time attention bias on the dot-probe task predicted greater trait anxiety among participants with low levels of cognitive control, with a more complex pattern predicting state anxiety. Conclusion Older adults do attend to social and physical stimuli differently. When stimuli concern a social threat, older adults do not preferentially attend to either neutral or negative stimuli. However, when stimuli concern physical threat, older adults preferentially attend to negative stimuli.

In each experiment, participants were primed with a camouflaged target appearing on the left or right of the screen, and then made a speeded response to a dot probe appearing on the same (congruent) or different (incongruent) side.

Yet, research experimentally investigating attention to itch is lacking. In this study we aimed to investigate attentional processing of itch using multiple behavioral attention tasks. Forty-one healthy participants performed (1) a modified Stroop task with itch-related words, (2) a dot-probe task with itch-related pictures, and (3) a recently developed somatosensory attention task in which the effect of experimentally induced itch on the localization of visual targets was examined. Additionally, a number of self-report questionnaires related to somatosensory attentional processing were administered. Results indicated that participants’ attention was biased toward itch-related words and pictures assessed by means of the dot-probe and modified Stroop task, respectively. For the somatosensory attention task, results showed that itch did not significantly influence the allocation of attention. However, when taking into account the time course of attention during the itch stimulus, data suggested that participants tended to disengage attention away during the itch stimulus. This is the first study that indicates an attentional bias for itch, using methods that have previously been validated for other sensations such as pain. In addition, the newly developed somatosensory attention task may reflect the time course of attention toward a tonic itch stimulus. © 2017 The Author(s)",,,,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021218075

Developments in experimental research demonstrate that it may be possible to manipulate such biases by means of Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). In the present paper, we summarize studies assessing cognitive biases in posttraumatic stress to serve as a theoretical and methodological background. However, our main aim was to provide an overview of the scientific literature on CBM in (analogue) posttraumatic stress. Results of our systematic literature review showed that most CBM studies targeted attentional and interpretation biases (attention: five studies; interpretation: three studies), and one study modified memory biases. Overall, results showed that CBM can indeed modify cognitive biases and affect (analog) trauma symptoms in a training congruent manner. Interpretation bias procedures seemed effective in analog samples, and memory bias training proved preliminary success in a clinical PTSD sample. Studies of attention bias modification provided more mixed results. This heterogeneous picture may be explained by differences in the type of population or variations in the CBM procedure. Therefore, we sketched a detailed research agenda targeting the challenges for CBM in posttraumatic stress. © 2017","Appraisal; Attention; Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM); Cognitive biases; Interpretation; Memory; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)","attentional bias; cognitive bias; human; injury; interpretation bias; medical literature; memory bias; posttraumatic stress disorder; Review; systematic review; training; anxiety; attention; cognition; memory; physiology; posttraumatic stress disorder; prejudice; psychology; Anxiety; Attention; Cognition; Humans; Memory; Prejudice; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","WO 2018 / 2-1, DFG, California Department of Fish and Game; 32-12/4, Daimler und Benz Stiftung; DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","Marcella L.

However, little is known about the time-course for the capture and hold of spatial attention by fearful, and other emotional, faces. In three dot-probe studies we examined this time-course. Experiments 1 and 2 used fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment 1, dot-probe targets occurred 133, 266, and 532 ms post-face onset and in Experiment 2, dot-probe targets occurred 84, 168, 336, and 672 ms post-face onset. In Experiment 1, for both 133 and 266 ms conditions, reaction times were fastest for congruent trials and slowest for incongruent trials with reaction times for baseline trials falling between the two. The same pattern was found for the 84 and 168 ms conditions in Experiment 2. For the later time-points in both experiments there were no significant differences between conditions. To examine whether this time-course is unique to fearful faces, a third dot-probe experiment using time-points identical to Experiment 2 was conducted with happy and neutral faces. The results from Experiment 3 suggest that happy faces captured and held attention in the 168 and 336 ms conditions. Together, the results indicate that attention is captured and held by fearful faces at times earlier than approximately 300 ms, while happy faces also captured and held attention, but on a slightly different time-course from 168 to 336 ms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Attentional bias; Dot-probe; Fearful faces; Happy faces; Stimulus-onset asynchrony","attentional bias; experimental model; human; human experiment; reaction time; stimulus",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008210929

However, unlike memory research, previous attention research has not systematically examined the potential role of referential processing focus. The present study tested the hypothesis that evidence of depression-linked attentional avoidance of positive information would be more readily obtained following the self-referential processing of such information. We assessed attentional responding to positive information (and also to negative information) using a dot-probe procedure, after this information had been processed either in a self-referential or other-referential manner. The findings lend support to the hypothesis under scrutiny. Participants scoring high in depression score exhibited reduced attention to positive information compared to those scoring low in depression score, but only when this information had been processed in a self-referential manner. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms that underpin attentional selectivity in depression, while potentially also helping to account for inconsistencies in previous literature. © 2017 The Authors","Attentional bias; Depression; Dot-probe task; Self-referential processing","attentional bias; avoidance behavior; human; anxiety; attentional bias; depression; memory; mental stress; physiology; psychology; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Depression; Humans; Memory; Stress, Psychological","DP140104448; DP140103713; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045","This work was supported by Australian Research Council Grants DP140104448 and DP140103713, and by a grant from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS?UEFISCDI, project number PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016808441

The purpose of the present study was to examine the relation between ABT and emotion dysregulation. Participants (N = 200) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires and a modified dot-probe task with both neutral and threat stimuli and four stimulus presentation durations. Task response times were used to examine traditionally calculated ABT scores, as well as attention bias variability (ABV). As predicted, those with greater emotion dysregulation exhibited greater ABV. Importantly, emotion dysregulation was not associated with response time variability on trials for which only neutral stimuli were presented, thus increasing confidence that emotion dysregulation-related ABV is specific to the presence of threat stimuli and not merely a function of general variability in response times.

Correlational evidence suggests that executive control could be used to regulate such threat-processing. On this basis, we hypothesized that trait anxiety-related cognitive biases regarding threat should be exaggerated when executive control is experimentally impaired by loading working memory. In Study 1, 68 undergraduates read ambiguous vignettes under high and low working memory load; later, their interpretations of these vignettes were assessed via a recognition test. Trait anxiety predicted biased interpretation of social threat vignettes under high working memory load, but not under low working memory load. In Study 2, 53 undergraduates completed a dot probe task with fear-conditioned Japanese characters serving as threat stimuli. Trait anxiety predicted attentional bias to the threat stimuli but, again, this only occurred under high working memory load. Interestingly however, actual eye movements toward the threat stimuli were only associated with state anxiety, and this was not moderated by working memory load, suggesting that executive control regulates biased threat-processing downstream of initial input processes such as orienting. These results suggest that cognitive loads can exacerbate trait anxiety-related cognitive biases, and therefore represent a useful tool for assessing cognitive biases in future research. More importantly, since biased threat-processing has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety, poor executive control may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Executive control; Interpretive bias; Working memory","adult; anxiety; Article; attentional bias; cognitive bias; executive function; eye movement; fear conditioning test; female; human; human experiment; male; mental load; normal human; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; threat; undergraduate student; working memory; anxiety; emotion; physiology; psychology; short term memory; statistical bias; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Bias; Emotions; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Young Adult","11B101, BAP, British Association for Psychopharmacology","This work was supported by BAP Grant 11B101 from I?ik University.

Attentional bias modification (ABM) interventions might, therefore, contribute to treatment outcome and the reduction of relapse rates. Based on some promising research findings, we designed a study to test the clinical relevance of ABM as an add-on component of regular intervention for alcohol and cannabis patients. Design/Methods: The current protocol describes a study which will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed home-delivered, multi-session, internet-based ABM (iABM) intervention as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU). TAU consists of cognitive behavioural therapy-based treatment according to the Dutch guidelines for the treatment of addiction. Participants (N = 213) will be outpatients from specialized addiction care institutions diagnosed with alcohol or cannabis dependency who will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: TAU + iABM; TAU + placebo condition; TAU-only. Primary outcome measures are substance use, craving, and rates of relapse. Changes in attentional bias will be measured to investigate whether changes in primary outcome measures can be attributed to the modification of attentional bias. Indices of cost-effectiveness and secondary physical and psychological complaints (depression, anxiety, and stress) are assessed as secondary outcome measures. Discussion: This randomized control trial will be the first to investigate whether a home-delivered, multi-session iABM intervention is (cost-) effective in reducing relapse rates in alcohol and cannabis dependency as an add-on to TAU, compared with an active and a waiting list control group. If proven effective, this ABM intervention could be easily implemented as a home-delivered component of current TAU.

The present study investigated EEG correlates of attentional bias patterns for pain-related information, with specific focus on avoidance- and vigilance-like behavior. Forty-one participants performed a dot-probe task, where neutral and pain-related words were used to create neutral, congruent, incongruent, and double (two pain-related words) trials. EEG was recorded, which was used to generate ERP’s of the word-processing phase and the post-dot phase. Participants were placed in two subgroups based on the direction of their attentional bias (either positive; toward the pain-related words, or negative; away from pain-related words). Using t-profiles, four latency windows were identified on which the two subgroups differed significantly. These latency windows yield areas which correspond with the P1-N1 domain and the P3b for the word-processing phase, while the post-dot phase latency windows cover the areas of the P200 and the P3b. The two subgroups show differences on congruent, incongruent, and the double trials, but interestingly also on the neutral trials. Most notably, the area in the word-phase associated with the P3b is diminished in the subgroup showing a negative bias. The deflections associated with both early and late attentional components, including the P3B, as well as a positive deflection in the timeframe of proposed response evaluation processes differ significantly between subgroups. In this study we demonstrated that different attentional biases exist in the healthy population, by showing differences in ERP’s. We also show differences in processing neutral trials, which suggests there are fundamental differences between these groups in processing words in general. © 2017 van Heck, Oosterman, de Kleijn, Jongsma and van Rijn.","Attention; Attentional bias; Avoidance; Behavior; Dot probe; EEG; Hypervigilance","adolescent; adult; alertness; Article; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; electroencephalography; emotion; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; language processing; latent period; male; normal human",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019255113

Preliminary work in pediatric clinical samples links irritability to attention bias to threat, and the current study examines this association in a large population-based sample. Methods: We studied 1,872 children (ages 6–14) using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and dot-probe tasks. Irritability was defined using CBCL items that assessed temper tantrums and hot temper. The dot-probe task assessed attention biases for threat-related (angry face) stimuli. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess specificity of associations to irritability when adjusting for demographic variables and co-occurring psychiatric traits. Propensity score matching analysis was used to increase causal inference when matching for demographic variables and co-occurring psychiatric traits. Results: Irritability was associated with increased attention bias toward threat-related cues. Multiple regression analysis suggests associations between irritability and threat bias are independent from demographic variables, anxiety, and externalizing traits (attention-deficit/hyperactivity, conduct, and headstrong/hurtful), but not from broad internalizing symptoms. Propensity score matching analysis indicated that this association was found for irritable versus nonirritable groups matched on demographic and co-occurring traits including internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Irritability in children is associated with biased attention toward threatening information. This finding, if replicated, warrants further investigation to examine the extent to which it contributes to chronic irritability and to explore possible treatment implications. © 2016 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","anger; attention; bias; cognition; emotion; Irritability","adolescent; adolescent behavior; attentional bias; child; child behavior; fear; female; human; irritability; male; mental disease; pathophysiology; physiology; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Attentional Bias; Child; Child Behavior; Fear; Female; Humans; Irritable Mood; Male; Mental Disorders",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84998780455

Here, we examine the developmental differences in infants' (4- to 24-month-olds) attention to social (angry faces) and nonsocial (snakes) threats using a new age-appropriate dot-probe task. In Experiment 1, infants' first fixations were more often to snakes than to frogs, and they were faster to fixate probes that appeared in place of snakes vs. frogs. There were no significant age differences, suggesting that a perceptual bias for snakes is present early in life and stable across infancy. In Experiment 2, infants fixated probes more quickly after viewing any trials that contained an angry face compared to trials that contained a happy face. Further, there were age-related changes in infants' responses to face stimuli, with a general increase in looking time to faces before the probe and an increase in latency to fixate the probe after seeing angry faces. Together, this work suggests that different developmental mechanisms may be responsible for attentional biases for social vs. nonsocial threats.

Method The study included 98 college students divided into three groups (i.e., high-, medium- and low-OSA) according to their OSA behavior. The personality types (i.e., self-control, BAS/BIS) and OSA behavior were investigated by questionnaires. The attentional bias was evaluated by the OS-related Stroop and dot-probe task (DPT) paradigms. Results OSA was positively predicted by time spent on online shopping per day and average consumption for online shopping monthly, and negatively by self-control. High-OSA individuals displayed significant attentional biases toward OS-related stimuli in the Stroop, but not DPT paradigm. Moreover, the attentional bias toward OSA-related stimuli in high-OSA individuals was negatively correlated with self-control. Conclusion These findings demonstrated the critical role of self-control in OSA behavior and attentional bias to OS-related stimuli in high-OSA individuals, indicating that more importance should be attached to self-control for the clinical intervention of online shopping addiction in future studies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; Article; attentional bias; behavior assessment; Behavioral Activation System Scale; Behavioral Inhibition System Scale; cognition assessment; college student; compulsive buying; female; human; major clinical study; male; motivation; online shopping addiction; Online Shopping Addiction Scale; online system; personality assessment; questionnaire; self control; Self Control Scale; self report; shopping; Stroop test; addiction; attentional bias; commercial phenomena; Internet; obsession; psychology; self control; student; young adult; Attentional Bias; Behavior, Addictive; Commerce; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Obsessive Behavior; Self-Control; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014647550

Seventy-three undergraduate female students (ages 17-24) completed a modified dot-probe task to assess whether young women showed a differential attentional bias pattern towards thin and non-thin female bodies. Participants also completed self-report measures of eating disorder pathology. It was found that increased reports of dietary restraint and body dissatisfaction were associated with both greater attentional bias towards thin bodies and avoidance of non-thin bodies (as compared to neutral images), although the former relationship was stronger than the latter. The results suggest attentional vigilance to thin-ideal images plays a greater role in the potential development and/or maintenance of eating disorder symptoms, at least in a university sample of young women. Results also revealed that eating disorder-specific rumination mediated the relationship between attentional bias to thin ideal images and eating disorder symptoms. These findings build on existing research and theories, for example the impaired disengagement model of rumination, and have potential clinical applications such as specifically targeting ruminative and/or attentional processes in the prevention and/or treatment of eating disorder symptoms. © 2017 Dondzilo et al.

Inhibitory control training could help improve treatment outcomes by strengthening cognitive control. This pilot study assessed the effects of acute inhibitory control training to drug- and non-drug-related cues on response inhibition performance and cocaine-cue attentional bias in cocaine-using individuals. Methods Participants who met criteria for a cocaine-use disorder underwent five sessions of inhibitory control training to either non-drug-related cues (i.e., rectangles) or cocaine cues (n = 10/condition) in a single day. Response inhibition and attentional bias were assessed prior to and following training using the stop-signal task and visual-probe task with eye tracking, respectively. Results Training condition groups did not differ on demographics, inhibitory control training performance, response inhibition, or cocaine-cue attentional bias. Response inhibition performance improved as a function of inhibitory control training in both conditions. Cocaine-cue attentional bias was observed, but did not change as a function of inhibitory control training in either condition. Conclusions Response inhibition in cocaine-using individuals was augmented by acute inhibitory control training, which may improve treatment outcomes through better behavioral inhibition.

Previous studies have found that the neuropeptide, oxytocin, can influence eating behaviour, lower the neurobiological stress response and anxiety among clinical populations, and alter attentional processing of food and eating related images in AN. Methodology Thirty adult women with AN and twenty-nine healthy comparison (HC) women took part in the current study. The study used double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design to investigate the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (40 IU) on a standard laboratory smoothie challenge, and on salivary cortisol, anxiety, and attentional bias towards food images before and after the smoothie challenge in AN and HC participants. Attentional bias was assessed using a visual probe task. Results Relative to placebo intranasal oxytocin reduced salivary cortisol and altered anomalies in attentional bias towards food images in the AN group only. The oxytocin-induced reduction in attentional avoidance of food images correlated with oxytocin induced reduction in salivary cortisol in the AN group before the smoothie challenge. Intranasal oxytocin did not significantly alter subjective feelings of anxiety or intake during the smoothie challenge in the AN or HC groups. Conclusions Intranasal oxytocin may moderate the automated information processing biases in AN and reduce neurobiological stress. Further investigation of the effects of repeated administration of oxytocin on these processes as well as on eating behaviour and subjective anxiety would be of interest. © 2017 The Authors","Anorexia nervosa; Anxiety; Attentional bias; Cortisol; Food; Oxytocin; Smoothie challenge","hydrocortisone; oxytocin; placebo; anxiolytic agent; hydrocortisone; oxytocin; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; attentional bias; beverage; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; feeding behavior; female; food intake; human; saliva level; single drug dose; smoothie; stress; anorexia nervosa; chemistry; drug effects; eating; food; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; intranasal drug administration; pathophysiology; photostimulation; psychology; saliva; young adult; Administration, Intranasal; Adult; Anorexia Nervosa; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Double-Blind Method; Eating; Female; Food; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Oxytocin; Photic Stimulation; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Saliva; Young Adult","ES/K009400/1, ESRC, Economic and Social Research Council; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; PB-PG-O7 12-28041, NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; R1405174; 82905; Menzies Centre for Australian Studies, King's College London, University of London; DH, Department of Health","The work conduced here was funded by The Swiss Anorexia Nervosa Foundation (CSP Ref: 82905) and Guy's and St. Thomas?

The Rational Positive Parenting Program (rPPP) is a program with a special focus on parent emotion-regulation functional reappraisal strategies, which has recently received consistent support for reducing child externalizing and internalizing disorders. In the last years, online interventions were proliferated and the Attention Bias Modification (ABM) becoming a promising implicit therapeutic intervention based on attention deployment emotion-regulation strategy, or adjunctive module to usual treatments, with results in multiple domains, varying from pain to self-esteem and emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety). We conducted two studies to investigate (1) the efficacy of the ABM procedures applied to parents and (2) the efficacy of the online version of the rPPP augmented with an ABM module. A total of 42 parents of children aged 2-12 years old participated in the first study, being allocated either to the ABM training or wait-list. Positive results were reported by the parents participating in the ABM group for own distress, satisfaction, positive interactions with the child, and child's strengths. In the second study, 53 parents and their children were allocated either in the rPPP group or in the rPPP + ABM group. Results show that ABM training can boost the effects of the rPPP on the strengths of children reported by the parents after the intervention.

If attentional bias is indeed of importance, changing this bias should then in turn have effects on insomnia complaints. In this double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial we investigated the efficacy of attentional bias modification training in the treatment of insomnia. Method: We administered baseline, post-test, and one-week follow-up measurements of insomnia severity, sleep-related worry, depression, and anxiety. Participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia were randomized into an attentional bias training group (n = 67) or a placebo training group (n = 70). Both groups received eight training sessions over the course of two weeks. All participants kept a sleep diary for four consecutive weeks (one week before until one week after the training sessions). Results: There was no additional benefit for the attentional bias training over the placebo training on sleep-related indices/outcome measures. Conclusions: The absence of the effect may be explained by the fact that there was neither attentional bias at baseline nor any reduction in the bias after the training.

However, the effects of CBM on SAD are not consistent. Some studies have demonstrated significant positive effects compared to control groups, while others have found no such effects. Aims We conducted a meta-analysis aimed at quantitatively assessing the effects of CBM on SAD at post-test. Method Through a systematic literature search by two independent raters, 34 articles (36 randomized studies) including 2,550 participants were identified. A multilevel modeling approach was employed to assess the effects of CBM on SAD, and to explore the potentially crucial procedures and sample characteristics that enhance the effectiveness of benign training. Results In general, there were small but significant effects of CBM on the primary symptoms of SAD (g = 0.17), cognitive bias (CB) toward threat (g = 0.32), and reactivity in stressful situations (g = 0.25), but non-significant effects on secondary symptoms. However, the interpretation modification program was more effective than was attentional bias modification in reducing SAD primary symptoms and negative CB. Laboratory training procedures produced larger primary symptom reductions compared to Internet-based training, whereas the percentage of contingency and feedback about training performance boosted cognitive effects only. Finally, the following groups were more likely to benefit from CBM: younger participants (primary symptoms and cognitive effects), women (primary symptom effects), and samples with stronger CB (stressor effects). The quality of the randomized controlled trials was less than desirable, as there was some indication of publication bias in our study. Conclusions Current findings broadly supported cognitive theories of SAD that consider a bidirectional or mutually reinforcing relationship between symptoms and CBs. However, the small therapeutic effect observed here indicates that it is necessary to develop more reliable and efficient CBM interventions that are specific to SAD. © 2017 Liu et al.

We found anisotropic distributions of probe detection rates for both overtly tracked and covertly tracked targets, with highest detection rates at locations ahead of the target's movement.

Modifying threat bias through cognitive retraining during adolescence reduces symptoms of anxiety, and so elucidating neural mechanisms of threat bias during adolescence is of high importance. We explored neural mechanisms by testing whether threat bias in adolescents is associated with generalized or threat-specific differences in the neural processing of faces. Method: Subjects were categorized into those with (n = 25) and without (n = 27) threat avoidance based on a dot-probe task at average age 12.9 years. Threat avoidance in this cohort has previously been shown to index threat bias. Brain response to individually presented angry and neutral faces was assessed in a separate session using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Adolescents with threat avoidance exhibited lower activity for both angry and neutral faces relative to controls in several regions in the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes involved in early visual and facial processing. Results: generalized to happy, sad, and fearful faces. Adolescents with a prior history of depression and/or an anxiety disorder had lower activity for all faces in these same regions. A subset of results replicated in an independent dataset. Conclusions: Threat bias is associated with generalized, rather than threat-specific, differences in the neural processing of faces in adolescents. Findings may aid in the development of novel treatments for anxiety disorders that use attention training to modify threat bias.

However, little research has investigated illness-specific cognitive processing in CFS. This study investigated whether CFS participants had an attentional bias for CFS-related stimuli and a tendency to interpret ambiguous information in a somatic way. It also determined whether cognitive processing biases were associated with co-morbidity, attentional control or self-reported unhelpful cognitions and behaviours. Method: A total of 52 CFS and 51 healthy participants completed self-report measures of symptoms, disability, mood, cognitions and behaviours. Participants also completed three experimental tasks, two designed specifically to tap into CFS salient cognitions: (i) visual-probe task measuring attentional bias to illness (somatic symptoms and disability) v. neutral words; (ii) interpretive bias task measuring positive v. somatic interpretations of ambiguous information; and (iii) the Attention Network Test measuring general attentional control. Results: Compared with controls, CFS participants showed a significant attentional bias for fatigue-related words and were significantly more likely to interpret ambiguous information in a somatic way, controlling for depression and anxiety. CFS participants had significantly poorer attentional control than healthy individuals. Attention and interpretation biases were associated with fear/avoidance beliefs. Somatic interpretations were also associated with all-or-nothing behaviour and catastrophizing. Conclusions: People with CFS have illness-specific biases which may play a part in maintaining symptoms by reinforcing unhelpful illness beliefs and behaviours. Enhancing adaptive processing, such as positive interpretation biases and more flexible attention allocation, may provide beneficial intervention targets.

Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores.

The aim of this study is to investigate associations between cognitive biases in alcohol-dependent patients, and how these measures relate to drinking behavior. Methods: Thirty alcohol-dependent patients and 15 healthy controls (matched for age, intelligence and education; all male) completed three cognitive bias tasks: the Implicit Association Test (IAT: alcohol-approach association), Approach Avoidance Task (AAT: alcohol approach bias) and Dot Probe Task (DPT: alcohol attentional bias). Task scores were compared between groups and correlated with each other, as well as with craving scores and drinking behavior. Results: Patients with alcohol dependence showed stronger alcohol-approach associations on the IAT compared with controls, but there were no group differences for approach or attentional biases. Within the patient group, the alcohol approach bias (AAT) correlated positively with the attend-alcohol attentional bias (DPT), but negatively with alcohol-approach associations (IAT). IAT scores were positively associated with lifetime alcohol intake. Conclusions: This study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol-dependent patients have stronger alcohol-approach association scores on the IAT as compared to controls, and that this bias is associated with drinking behavior. Despite the absence of group differences for the approach and attentional biases, the positive correlation between these biases in alcoholics is in line with incentive salience models of addiction that propose that attentional and approach tendencies have a common underlying mechanism, distinct from that underlying alcohol-approach associations measured by the IAT. Short Summary: The study investigates associations between cognitive biases involving alcohol cues. Patients with alcohol dependence showed stronger alcohol-approach associations on an Implicit Association Test than controls, but there were no group differences for approach or attentional biases. Alcohol-approach and attentional bias correlated positively in the patient group. © The Author 2016.",,"alcohol; adult; alcohol abstinence; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Approach Avoidance Task; Article; association; attentional bias; behavior disorder assessment; clinical article; cognitive bias; comparative study; controlled study; Dot Probe Task; drinking behavior; human; Implicit Association Test; male; priority journal; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; alcoholism; cognition; middle aged; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Cognition; Cues; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time","EA 12 39; DFG_FOR_1617, DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; BMBF-01KR1207C","This study was supported by grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF-01KR1207C) and the German Research Foundation (DFG_FOR_1617).

Reliance on a single task to capture attention bias, in this case overwhelmingly the dot-probe task, may contribute to this inconsistency. Comparing across attentional bias measures could help capture patterns of behavior that have implications for anxiety. This study examines the patterns of attentional bias across two related measures in a sample of children at temperamental risk for anxiety. Children (Meanage = 10.19 ± 0.96) characterized as behaviorally inhibited (N = 50) or non-inhibited (N = 64) via parent-report completed the dot-probe and affective Posner tasks to measure attentional bias to threat. Parent-report diagnostic interviews assessed children's social anxiety. Behavioral inhibition was not associated with performance in the dot-probe task, but was associated with increased attentional bias to threat in the affective Posner task. Cross-task convergence was dependent on temperament, such that attention bias across the two tasks was only related in behaviorally inhibited children. Finally, children who were consistently biased across tasks (showing high or low attentional bias scores in both tasks, rather than high in one but low in the other) had higher levels of anxiety. Convergence across attention bias measures may be dependent on individuals' predispositions (e.g. temperament). Moreover, convergence of attention bias across measures may be a stronger marker of information processing patterns that shape socioemotional outcomes than performance in a single task. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"anxiety; attention; attentional bias; child; child behavior; etiology; fear; human; inhibition (psychology); pathophysiology; physiology; Anxiety; Attention; Attentional Bias; Child; Child Behavior; Fear; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology)","R01MH094633, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health","This study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH094633 to KPE).

Results: Recovered AN women did not exhibit a behavioral attentional bias to threat. In response to angry faces, recovered women showed significant hypoactivation in the extrastriate cortex. During attentional bias to angry faces, recovered women showed significant hyperactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex.

No differences between groups were found for happy or sad faces. Furthermore, correlational analyses showed that the higher avoidance of angry faces, the greater are the social communication difficulties of ASD children.

Methods Sixty-four participants between the ages of 18–34 years completed two experiments involving tests of attentional bias, mood, and memory before and after a cycling protocol or seated rest control condition. Participants were categorized into low-trait anxious (n = 29) or high-trait anxious (n = 35) groups and randomly allocated to experimental conditions. For both experiments, participants completed the assessments before and following 20 min of moderate intensity exercise or seated rest. Experiment 1 examined word-based attentional bias, while Experiment 2 utilized picture-based attentional bias tests. Results Acute moderate exercise did not alter word-based attentional bias. Exercise decreased picture-based attentional bias, but failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.057). Enhancements in participants’ mood post-exercise were observed; effects of exercise on memory were inconsistent. Conclusion The effects of acute exercise on attentional bias seems to depend on stimulus type. Results suggest that exercise has a greater impact on picture-based attentional bias pre- to post-exercise (Experiment 2) compared to word-based attentional bias (Experiment 1). Moderate intensity exercise improves measures of total mood disturbance, anger, confusion, state anxiety, vigor and tension.

This is indicative of an attentional bias towards alcohol. The goal of this study was to examine this bias in problematic drinkers with and without mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) using both eye tracking methodology and behavioural data (i.e. reaction time (RT) data). Method: Participants (N = 133) were divided into four groups based on (estimated) full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) and severity of alcohol use-related problems. The severity of substance use-related problems was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). The visual dot probe task was used to measure the attentional bias. We analysed both eye tracking data and behavioural data (i.e. RT data) of the visual dot probe task. Results: Problematic drinkers were not more likely than light drinkers to direct their attention towards pictures of alcoholic beverages, did not look at these pictures longer than light drinkers and did also not respond faster than light drinkers to probes replacing pictures of alcoholic beverages. However, the strength of the attentional bias varied profusely. Conclusion: Taking the large variability in the strength of the attentional bias and the poor psychometric qualities of the measures into consideration, it is concluded that the use of these measures for clinical purposes is discouraged. © 2016 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","addiction; alcohol; attentional bias; eye tracking; mild intellectual disability","adult; aged; alcoholic beverage; alcoholism; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; disease severity; eye tracking; female; human; intellectual impairment; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; response time; stimulus response; task performance; visual stimulation; adolescent; alcoholism; attentional bias; intellectual impairment; middle aged; neuropsychological test; oculography; pathophysiology; physiology; severity of illness index; standards; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Attentional Bias; Eye Movement Measurements; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992188101

This study investigated how family system types predict children's attentional biases toward facial expressions at the age of 10 years. The participants were 79 children from Cohesive, Disengaged, Enmeshed, and Authoritarian family types based on marital and parental relationship trajectories from pregnancy to the age of 12 months. A dot-probe task was used to assess children's emotional attention biases toward threatening (angry) and affiliative (happy) faces at the early (500 ms) and late (1250 ms) stages of processing. Situational priming was applied to activate children's sense of danger or safety. Results showed that children from Cohesive families had an early-stage attentional bias toward threat, whereas children from Enmeshed families had a late-stage bias toward threat. Children from Disengaged families had an early-stage attentional bias toward threat, but showed in addition a late-stage bias away from emotional faces (i.e., both angry and happy). Children from Authoritarian families, in turn, showed a late-stage attentional bias toward emotional faces.

Attention bias may be related to enhanced amygdala activity or altered amygdala functional connectivity in depression. The current study examined attention bias, brain activity for emotional images, and functional connectivity in post-menopausal women with and without a history of major depression. Methods Attention bias for emotionally valenced images was examined in 33 postmenopausal women with (n=12) and without (n=21) a history of major depression using an emotion dot probe task during fMRI. Group differences in amygdala activity and functional connectivity were assessed using fMRI and examined for correlations to attention performance. Results Women with a history of MDD showed greater attentional bias for negative images and greater activity in brain areas including the amygdala for both positive and negative images (pcorr <0.001) than women without a history of MDD. In all participants, amygdala activity for negative images was correlated with attention facilitation for emotional images. Women with a history of MDD had significantly greater functional connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampal complex.

Findings regarding the time course of attentional bias have been inconsistent, possibly because RT tasks are sensitive to processes downstream of attention. Methods Attentional bias was assessed using an accuracy-based task in which participants detected a single digit in two simultaneous rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) streams of letters. Before the target, two coloured shapes were presented simultaneously, one in each RSVP stream; one shape had previously been associated with threat through Pavlovian fear conditioning. Attentional bias was indicated wherever participants identified targets in the threat's RSVP stream more accurately than targets in the other RSVP stream. Results In 87 unselected undergraduates, trait anxiety only predicted attentional bias when the target was presented immediately following the shapes, i.e. 160 ms later; by 320 ms the bias had disappeared. This suggests attentional bias in anxiety can be extremely brief and transitory. Limitations This initial study utilised an analogue sample, and was unable to physiologically verify the efficacy of the conditioning. The next steps will be to verify these results in a sample of diagnosed anxious patients, and to use alternative threat stimuli. Conclusions The results of studies using response time to assess the time course of attentional bias may partially reflect later processes such as decision making and response preparation. This may limit the efficacy of therapies aiming to retrain attentional biases using response time tasks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; Attentional bias; RT vs. accuracy; Time course","anxiety; attentional bias; consensus development; decision making; diagnosis; finger; human; human experiment; human tissue; response time; stimulus; threat; adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; anxiety; association; attentional bias; behavior therapy; fear; female; linguistics; menstrual cycle; online system; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychology; reaction time; rehabilitation; Stroop test; time factor; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Association; Attentional Bias; Behavior Therapy; Fear; Female; Humans; Menstrual Cycle; Online Systems; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Stroop Test; Time Factors; Visual Perception; Vocabulary; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977108930

Androstadienone has been studied with respect to effects on mood states, attractiveness ratings, physiological and neural activation. With the current experiment, we aimed to explore in which way androstadienone affects attention to social cues (human faces). Moreover, we wanted to test whether effects depend on specific emotions, the participants' sex and individual sensitivity to smell androstadienone. To do so, we investigated 56 healthy individuals (thereof 29 females taking oral contraceptives) with two attention tasks on two consecutive days (once under androstadienone, once under placebo exposure in pseudorandomized order). With an emotional dot-probe task we measured visuo-spatial cueing while an emotional Stroop task allowed us to investigate interference control. Our results suggest that androstadienone acts in a sex, task and emotion-specific manner as a reduction in interference processes in the emotional Stroop task was only apparent for angry faces in men under androstadienone exposure. More specifically, men showed a smaller difference in reaction times for congruent compared to incongruent trials. At the same time also women were slightly affected by smelling androstadienone as they classified angry faces more often correctly under androstadienone. For the emotional dotprobe task no modulation by androstadienone was observed. Furthermore, in both attention paradigms individual sensitivity to androstadienone was neither correlated with reaction times nor error rates in men and women. To conclude, exposure to androstadienone seems to potentiate the relevance of angry faces in both men and women in connection with interference control, while processes of visuo-spatial cueing remain unaffected. © 2017 Hornung et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"androsta 4,16 dien 3 one; oral contraceptive agent; 4,16-androstadien-3-one; androstane derivative; fragrance; oral contraceptive agent; pheromone; placebo; anger; Article; attention; controlled study; facial expression; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; olfactory discrimination; response time; sex difference; Stroop test; task performance; adolescent; adult; affect; anger; association; chemistry; drug effects; facial recognition; odor; physiology; reaction time; sweat; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Androstadienes; Anger; Contraceptives, Oral; Cues; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Male; Odorants; Pheromones, Human; Placebos; Reaction Time; Smell; Stroop Test; Sweat; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016621735

These deficits may be acquired during the development of obesity rather than being a prerequisite thereof. The current study, hence, focused on an at-risk population versus controls. Normal-weight children of obese and normal-weight parents were tested regarding attentional flexibility, emotion regulation, and inhibitory control. A sample of 50 preschoolers of obese parents (n = 25) or normal-weight parents (n = 25) participated in this study. Through eye-tracking, attentional bias for food cues was measured during a visual probe task using food and toy images. Emotion regulation was assessed during a distress-evoking task, and inhibitory control was examined through a delay-of-gratification task. Both tasks are standardized and were conducted in non-food contexts. Results showed no significant group differences in overall attentional bias to food images over toy images. However, children of normal-weight parents showed a preference for toy images. Regarding emotion regulation, children in the risk group expressed significantly less overall emotional distress. In addition, less gaze aversion and bodily sadness could be observed in this group. No differences were found for inhibitory control. Findings suggest that general deficits in self-regulation are not yet present in normal-weight children at risk for obesity. Instead, they might develop as a by-product of unhealthy weight gain. Results indicate, however, that children of obese parents are less emotionally expressive compared with children of normal-weight parents. Furthermore, children of normal-weight parents appeared to be more interested in toy images than in food images. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Attention bias; Childhood; Emotion regulation; Obesity; Self-regulation","association; attentional bias; child; childhood obesity; emotion; feeding behavior; female; human; inhibition (psychology); longitudinal study; male; parent; physiology; preschool child; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; self control; Attentional Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Cues; Emotions; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Longitudinal Studies; Male; Parents; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Factors; Self-Control; Surveys and Questionnaires","DFG, California Department of Fish and Game; BMBF, Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; 01EO1001, BMBF, Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; A5, CRC, CRC Health Group","We thank Madeleine Ordnung for her help in evaluating the video material and thank Corinna Bonhage for providing help with the eye-tracker.

Recent incidents involving apparent profiling and aggressive behavior have led to accusations that the police are sometimes biased. Given that previous research has shown a link between clothing and cognition, we investigated the question of whether the police uniform itself might induce a bias in social attention. To address this question, and using a Canadian university student sample, we assessed whether wearing a police uniform biases attention toward black faces compared to white faces, and low-status individuals compared to high-status individuals. In Experiment 1 (n = 28), participants wore either a police-style uniform or mechanic overalls, and performed a shape categorization task in the presence of a distractor that could be either: a black face, a white face, a person wearing a hoodie (whom we propose will be associated with low SES), or a person wearing a suit (whom we propose will be associated with high SES). Participants wearing the police-style uniform exhibited biased attention, indexed by slower reaction times (RTs), in the presence of low-SES images. In Experiment 2 (n = 28), we confirmed this bias using a modified Dot-Probe task - an alternate measure of attentional bias in which we observed faster RTs to a dot probe that was spatially aligned with a low SES image. Experiment 3 (n = 56) demonstrated that attentional bias toward low-SES targets appears only when participants wear the police-style uniform, and not when they are simply exposed to it - by having it placed on the desk in front of them. Our results demonstrate that wearing a police-style uniform biases attention toward low-SES targets. Thus, wearing a police-style uniform may induce a kind of ""status-profiling"" in which individuals from low-status groups become salient and capture attention. We note that our results are limited to university students and that it will be important to extend them to members of the community and law-enforcement officers. We discuss how uniforms might exert their effects on cognition by virtue of the power and cultural associations they evoke in the wearer. © 2017 Civile and Obhi.","Attention; High-status; Low-status; Police uniform; Race effect",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014038036

The association between EAC and avoidant attentional biases to emotional stimuli in dementia caregivers, and the potential mediating role of these attentional biases in the association between EAC and increased BP are explored. Method: Seventy nine dementia family caregivers performed a dot-probe task with emotional pictures (distressing and positive) varying in content (general vs. caregiving-related (CR)) and time of exposure (100 vs. 500 ms). They also completed measures of EAC, anxiety, depression, alexithymia and rumination, and their BP was measured. Results: EAC was associated with avoidant attentional biases to CR emotional pictures and negative pictures in general at 100 ms. Experiential Avoidance in Caregiving Questionnaire (EACQ) ‘avoidant behaviors’ and EACQ ‘intolerance of negativity’ factors were associated with diastolic and systolic BP, respectively, with attentional avoidance of CR emotional pictures (distressing and positive, respectively) mediating this association.

Method: One hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomized to receive threatening or reassuring information about the cold pressor task; and divided into high and low FOP groups. Participants completed the dot-probe task, while their eye movements were tracked. Results: Results showed that those who received threatening information were less likely to have their first fixation on pain words, particularly affective pain words. Furthermore, under conditions of high threat, the high FOP group who did fixate on affective pain words, fixated more quickly than for sensory pain words, whereas the opposite was the case under low threat. In regression analyses, initial vigilance towards affective pain words was a significant predictor of reporting pain more quickly on the cold pressor. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that initial vigilance of affective pain stimuli predicts actual hypervigilance to an acute experimental pain task. However, under conditions of high threat, participants show evidence of avoidance of affective pain words, even though when they do fixate on these stimuli, the high FOP group does so more quickly.

However, the variability of attentional biases may contain essential information related to behavior and symptoms. Bias variability refers to short-time scale fluctuation in bias to and from salient stimuli, measurable within the duration of a task. The first aim of the current study was to relate attentional bias variability for alcohol cues to risky drinking behavior. The second aim was to explore a conditioned-cue version of the dot probe in which arbitrary cues signaled the location of subsequent alcoholic or nonalcoholic pictorial cues, which was designed to avoid sources of interference that could play a role in the normal dot probe. Results showed strong associations between measures of attentional bias variability and drinking behavior. Effects in the conditioned cues version of the task were weaker and appeared to require a longer training period. Nevertheless, heavier drinkers tended to respond too late to probes appearing at locations of cues predicting the appearance of nonalcohol stimuli. This suggests that predictive cues can capture an aspect of attentional processes related to alcohol use. The results indicate that attentional bias variability is worth studying further. It may be fruitful for theory and future research to focus on fluctuations in attention rather than consistent tendencies toward or away from alcohol. The potential use of predictive cues remains uncertain. Such designs may require relatively long training periods but could prove methodologically and theoretically useful. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Alcohol; attentional bias; attentional bias variability; conditioned cues; dot probe; risky drinking",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976351461

Symptom changes did not differ based on condition and were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Attentional biases during the dot-probe task were not related to symptom change. Overall, our results replicate support for the efficacy of both protocols in reducing symptoms of SAD and specific related constructs, and suggest a role of exposure, expectancy, or practice effects, rather than attention modification, in effecting such reductions. The current results also support distinct relationships between fears of negative and positive evaluation and social anxiety. Further research focused on identifying the mechanisms of change in attention modification protocols appears warranted. © 2016 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy.","attention modification protocol; Attentional bias; longitudinal study; randomized controlled trial; social anxiety disorder","adult; attentional bias; computer assisted therapy; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; human; male; Phobia, Social; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Adult; Attentional Bias; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Phobia, Social; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981731406

We assessed whether attention bias modification training (ABMT), delivered immediately prior to combat, attenuates the association between combat exposure and stress-related symptoms. 99 male soldiers preparing for combat were randomized to receive either an ABMT condition designed to enhance vigilance toward threat or an attention control training (ACT) designed to balance attention deployment between neutral and threat words. Frequency of combat events, and symptoms of PTSD and depression were measured prior to deployment and at a two-month follow-up. Regression analysis revealed that combat exposure uniquely accounted for 4.6% of the variance in stress-related symptoms change from baseline to follow-up and that the interaction between ABMT and combat exposure accounted for additional 5.4% of the variance.

Herein is presented a randomized controlled trial to test the effects of retraining the dot probe attentional bias at short versus long stimulus durations towards neutral stimuli, and away from threat stimuli, on acute pain experience, in comparison with a placebo control group. Methods: Eighty-one pain-free volunteers, blinded to condition, were randomized to complete either one of two neutral bias modification programs in which words were presented for 500 ms (ABM-500; n = 28) or 1250 ms (ABM-1250; n = 26), or to a sham training program that included both stimulus durations (ABM-Placebo; n = 27). Testing took place in a university laboratory. At post-training, participants completed the pain-inducing ‘cold pressor task’, and measures of pain severity, threshold and tolerance were taken. Attentional bias was also measured at pre- and post-training. Results: Findings indicated that ABM-500 reliably increased pain threshold and tolerance, in comparison with the control group. In contrast, ABM-1250 did not affect any of the pain outcomes. Expected ABM effects on attentional bias were not evident at the group level, but nevertheless ABM-500 bias reduction was significantly associated with increased pain tolerance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that retraining attention at short stimulus exposure durations is relatively more efficacious in promoting transfer of attentional retraining effects to real-world acute pain stressors, in comparison with both the longer stimulus duration and ABM-Placebo. Significance: Testing of the impact of modifying maintained attentional bias on vulnerability to an acute pain stressor. Findings suggested that retraining rapid attentional bias using short exposure durations conferred greater analgesic benefit, in comparison with both the slower bias and sham-training. © 2016 European Pain Federation - EFIC®",,"placebo; adult; Article; attentional bias; cold pressor test; comparative study; controlled study; experimental pain; female; health program; human; male; normal human; outcome assessment; pain measurement; pain severity; pain threshold; priority journal; self report; sham procedure; single blind procedure; stimulus response; treatment duration; cognitive therapy; pain; pain threshold; psychology; randomized controlled trial; time factor; young adult; Acute Pain; Adult; Attentional Bias; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold; Single-Blind Method; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006320938

However, alcoholic beverage preferences play an important part in determining an individual’s alcohol use pattern and may influence attentional biases, especially for inexperienced drinkers. The current study examined whether alcoholic beverage preferences affect event-related potential (ERP) indices of cue reactivity to different types of alcohol images (e.g., beer, wine, and distilled spirits) in heavy episodic drinkers. Method: ERPs were recorded in 14 heavy episodic drinkers (7 male) who completed a Go/No-Go task using preferred and nonpreferred alcohol images with nonalcoholic beverage images as controls. Results: Larger N2 amplitudes for preferred alcohol images were observed relative to control images and to nonpreferred alcohol images, indicating increased attentional capture by preferred beverages. P3 amplitudes and latencies were not sensitive to preferences, but latencies were delayed and amplitudes were enhanced on No-Go trials (i.e., trials requiring response inhibition). Conclusions: These results suggest that alcoholic beverage preference is a factor influencing alcohol cue reactivity in heavy-episodic-drinking college students. This information has methodological significance and may also be applied to improve treatment and prevention programs that focus on attentional bias modification and inhibitory control training. © 2017, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

However, over the last years, it has been suggested that AB in SAD may result from a decreased activation of the left prefrontal cortex, and particularly of its dorsolateral part (dlPFC). Accordingly, a transient increase of neural activity within the left dlPFC via non-invasive brain stimulation decreases AB in non-anxious control participants. Yet, none of these studies focused on SAD. This is especially unfortunate as SAD constitutes the main target for which a genuine reduction of AB may be most appropriate. In this experiment, we sought to investigate the causal influence of left dlPFC neuromodulation on AB among 19 female individuals with a DSM-5 diagnosis of SAD. We adopted a double-blind within-subject protocol in which we delivered a single-session of anodal versus sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) over the left dlPFC during the completion of a probe discrimination task assessing AB. Consistent with our hypothesis, participants demonstrated a significant decrease in AB during the anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC relative to the sham stimulation. These findings value tDCS as an innovative procedure to gain new insight into the underlying mechanisms of SAD. © The Author (2016).","Attention bias modification; Attentional bias; Neuromodulation; Prefrontal cortex; Social anxiety disorder; Transcranial direct current stimulation","adult; arousal; attentional bias; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; fear; female; hemispheric dominance; human; male; pathophysiology; Phobia, Social; physiology; prefrontal cortex; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult; Adult; Arousal; Attentional Bias; Dominance, Cerebral; Double-Blind Method; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Phobia, Social; Prefrontal Cortex; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult","sub/2015/228106243177; BOF16/GOA/017, FWO, Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; FWO08/PDO/168","The authors are also thankful to Laura Genon and CharlotteCoussement for their help with data collection.

The present study addressed whether attention training toward pleasant stimuli can reduce anxiety symptoms and induce a processing bias in favor of pleasant information in nonpatients who were selected to score similarly to individuals with generalized anxiety or panic disorder on a measure of worry or physiological arousal, respectively. Participants were randomly assigned to attention training to pleasant (ATP) stimuli or to a placebo control (PC) condition. All participants completed baseline and post-test dot-probe measures of attentional bias while event-related brain potentials were recorded. As expected, worry symptoms decreased in the ATP and not PC condition. ATP was also associated with early evidence (P100 amplitude) of greater attentional prioritization of probes replacing neutral stimuli within threat-neutral word pairs from pre-to-post intervention and later RT evidence of facilitated processing of probes replacing pleasant stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs at post compared to PC. PC was associated with later evidence (P300 latency) of less efficient evaluation of probes following pleasant stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs from pre-to-post and later RT evidence of facilitated processing of probes following threat stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs at post compared to ATP.

The unreliability of self-report measures in eating disorders due to strong denial of illness gave rise to experimental studies inspired by research into anxiety disorders involving attentional bias, with the prevalent method being a modified color-naming Stroop task. Unfortunately, that tool was shown to exhibit many limitations, especially in terms of attentional bias measurement. Thus, researchers started to seek alternative methods of evaluating attention in persons with eating disorders. Along with the Stroop test and the Posner paradigm, one of the most frequently used methods is the dot probe task. This paper presents the dot probe protocol as well as the rationale underpinning its use, including its advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, a modification of the task is proposed to enable the assessment of all components of attentional bias in patients with eating disorders. The paper also discusses practical implications of the modification for the treatment of these patients. For several years now there has been an increasingly widespread use of so-called attentional training employing, amongst others, the dot probe task, which may be modified for the purpose of reducing or eliminating of attentional biases in patients with eating disorders. Unfortunately, due to the absence of studies providing a reliable account of all types of attentional bias in eating disorders, this field of research lags considerably behind anxiety research and does not enable therapeutic applications. © 2017, CIRIEC.

For the prediction of APOP in chest malformation patients and cancer patients, we found pain-specific psychological predictors to be of higher relevance than general psychological predictors. The current study aims to further substantiate these findings. Materials and Methods: In a sample of 73 middle-aged hysterectomy patients, 3 predictor sets were assessed 1 day before surgery: attentional biases (toward pain-related, social threat, and positive words in a dot-probe task), pain-related emotions and cognitions (pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and pain hypervigilance), and affective state variables (depression and somatization). APOP intensity rated 2 to 3 days after surgery and analgesic consumption during the first 48 postoperative hours were used as outcome measures. Results: APOP intensity ratings were significantly explained by their best single predictors in a multiple regression analysis: social threat words of the dot-probe task, pain anxiety, and somatization (14.7% of explained variance). When comparing standardized β coefficients, pain-specific psychological predictors appeared to be of higher explanatory relevance than general psychological predictors. In contrast, analgesic consumption could not be significantly predicted by the psychological variables. Discussion: Hysterectomy patients at risk for high APOP intensity could be characterized by the psychological variables used, whereas their predictive value for analgesic consumption was limited. The high predictive potency of pain-specific psychological variables should be considered for further improvement of pain management and prevention, because pain-specific variables such as pain anxiety can be the target of focal psychological interventions when preparing for surgery. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Regarding BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words, BPD patients reveal an even stronger AB than NPs (SMD = 0.454). The VDPT studies indicate a tendency towards an AB to positive facial stimuli but not negative stimuli in BPD patients compared to NPs. Conclusions: The findings rather reflect an AB in BPD to generally negative and BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words rather than an AB in BPD towards facial stimuli, and/or a biased allocation of covert attentional resources to negative emotional stimuli in BPD and not a bias in focus of visual attention. Further research regarding the role of childhood traumatization and comorbid anxiety disorders may improve the understanding of these underlying processes. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, responding to animacy stimuli has not been systematically investigated. Yet, the amygdala is known to be responsive to animacy stimuli and impairment in responsiveness to animacy information may have implications for social cognitive development. Twenty-nine youth with DBDs and 20 typically developing youth, matched for IQ, age (Mage = 14.45, SD = 2.05) and gender, completed a dot probe task during fMRI. Stimuli consisted of negative/faces, negative/objects, neutral/faces and neutral/objects images. Youth with DBDs, relative to typically developing youth, showed: i) reduced amygdala and lateral temporal cortex responses to faces relative to objects. Moreover, within the group of youth with DBDs, increasing callous-unemotional traits were associated with lesser amygdala responses to faces relative to objects. These data suggest that youth with DBDs, particularly those with high levels of CU traits exhibit dysfunction in animacy processing in the amygdala. This dysfunction may underpin the asociality reported in these youth. © 2017 The Authors","Adolescent; Amygdala; Conduct Disorder; fMRI; Oppositional Defiant Disorder","adolescent; amygdala; animacy information; anterior cingulate; Article; attention deficit disorder; BOLD signal; brain region; callous unemotional trait; caudate nucleus; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; culmen; disruptive behavior; dot probe task; emotion; facial expression; female; frontal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; human; inferior parietal cortex; insula; intelligence quotient; male; mental task; middle frontal gyrus; middle occipital gyrus; parahippocampal gyrus; postcentral gyrus; primary motor cortex; priority journal; response time; temporal cortex","National Institute of Mental Health; 1-ZIA-MH002860, National Institutes of Health; NCT00104039, National Institutes of Health; 05-M-0105, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health ( 1-ZIA-MH002860 ), Dr. Blair principle investigator.

Here, we applied a unique task that used peripheral distractors that presented emotional and spatial information simultaneously. Notably, the emotional information was not associated in any way to the task, and thus was task-irrelevant. The spatial information, however, was task-relevant as it corresponded with task instructions. Corroborating previous findings, anxious patients showed attentional bias toward negative information. MDD patients showed no indication of this bias. Spatial information influenced all groups similarly.

This study investigated attentional bias towards unhealthy foods at different stages of attentional processing in a clinical sample, comparing obese patients (Body Mass Index, BMI&gt;35 kg/m2) with and without binge eating behaviors. Participants were separated into two groups according to their score on the Binge Eating Scale (BES): no binge eating (NB; score ≤17; n = 23) and binge eating (BE; score &gt; 17; n = 19). Participants performed a computerized visual probe task designed to evaluate attentional bias in different stages of attentional process; matching pairs of unhealthy food and matching non-food pictures concealed a target for 100, 500 or 2000 ms. Reduced reaction times to targets following food-related images are indicative of attentional bias towards food images. BE group exhibited a greater bias towards food than NB. Both groups showed positive attentional bias to food in the initial orientation stage (100 ms), whereas bias was close to zero in the maintenance of attention stage (2000 ms), suggesting ambivalent approach-avoidance responses to food stimuli. Only the BE group showed a bias towards food images when displayed for 500 ms, indicating disengaging from food-related stimuli was faster in NB group. Although both groups were ambivalent about attending to food cues, slower attentional disengagement from unhealthy food might be a cognitive marker of binge eating behavior in severe obesity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attentional bias; Bariatric surgery; Binge eating disorder; Food; Obesity; Visual probe task","adult; Article; attentional bias; binge eating disorder; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; female; food; food intake; human; male; obesity; photography; rating scale; reaction time; stimulus; aged; attentional bias; binge eating disorder; Brazil; bulimia; cognition; diet; middle aged; morbid obesity; physiology; psychology; Adult; Aged; Attentional Bias; Binge-Eating Disorder; Body Mass Index; Brazil; Bulimia; Cognition; Diet; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid","CNPq, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; CAPES, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; 305082/2012-4, CNPq, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; 461622/2014-9, CNPq, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; CAPES, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior","This research was supported by CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) ( 305082/2012-4 and 461622/2014-9 ).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995766569

The neuropeptide oxytocin triggers anxiolytic functions and enhances eye gaze, facial emotion recognition and neural correlates of face processing in ASD. Here we investigated whether a single dose of oxytocin increases attention to faces in ASD. As a secondary question, we explored the influence of social anxiety on these effects. We tested for oxytocin's effects on attention to neutral faces as compared to houses in a sample of 29 autistic individuals and 30 control participants using a dot-probe paradigm with two different presentation times (100 or 500 ms). A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under placebo, ASD individuals paid less attention to faces presented for 500 ms than did controls. Oxytocin administration increased the allocation of attention toward faces in ASD to a level observed in controls. Secondary analyses revealed that these oxytocin effects primarily occurred in ASD individuals with high levels of social anxiety who were characterized by attentional avoidance of faces under placebo. Our results confirm a positive influence of intranasal oxytocin on social attention processes in ASD. Further, they suggest that oxytocin may in particular restore the attentional preference for facial information in ASD individuals with high social anxiety. We conclude that oxytocin's anxiolytic properties may partially account for its positive effects on socio-cognitive functioning in ASD, such as enhanced eye gaze and facial emotion recognition. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"oxytocin; placebo; oxytocin; adult; Article; attentional bias; autism; avoidance behavior; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; face; human; latent period; male; randomized controlled trial; secondary analysis; single drug dose; social phobia; visual attention; attention; autism; decision making; drug effects; facial expression; facial recognition; female; middle aged; psychology; reaction time; social phobia; Adult; Attention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Choice Behavior; Double-Blind Method; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxytocin; Phobia, Social; Reaction Time","DFG Do1312/2-1, DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Do1312/2-3, DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","We are most grateful to all participants who took part in this study and thank all the students who assisted in data collection.

AB scores were not associated with BI group or parent-rated anxiety symptoms. Trials requiring attention orienting away from threat engaged an executive and threat-attention network (dlPFC, vlPFC, mPFC, and amygdala). Within that network, behaviorally inhibited children showed greater activation in the right dlPFC. Heightened dlPFC activation related to increased anxiety, and BI levels accounted for the direct relation between dlPFC activation and anxiety. Behaviorally inhibited children may engage the executive attention system during threat-related processing as a compensatory mechanism.

Recently, researchers have developed specific attentional bias modification (ABM) techniques aimed to modify these maladaptive attentional patterns. However, the application of current ABM procedures has yielded, so far, scarce results in depression due, in part, to some methodological shortcomings. The aim of our protocol is the application of a new ABM technique, based on eye-tracker technology, designed to objectively train the specific attentional components involved in depression and, eventually, to reduce depressive symptoms. Methods: Based on sample size calculations, 32 dysphoric (BDI ≥13) participants will be allocated to either an active attentional bias training group or a yoked-control group. Attentional training will be individually administered on two sessions in two consecutive days at the lab. In the training task series of pairs of faces (i.e. neutral vs. sad; neutral vs. happy; happy vs. sad) will be displayed. Participants in the training group will be asked to localize as quickly as possible the most positive face of the pair (e.g., the neutral face in neutral vs. sad trials) and maintain their gaze on it for 750 ms or 1500 ms, in two different blocks, to advance to the next trial. Participants' maintenance of gaze will be measured by an eye-tracking apparatus. Participants in the yoked-control group will be exposed to the same stimuli and the same average amount of time than the experimental participants but without any instruction to maintain their gaze or any feedback on their performance. Pre and post training measures will be obtained to assess cognitive and emotional changes after the training. Discussion: The findings from this research will provide a proof-of-principle of the efficacy of eye-tracking paradigms to modify attentional biases and, consequently, to improve depressed mood. If the findings are positive, this new training approach may result in the improvement of cognitive bias modification procedures in depression.

Attentional models of associative learning suggest that blocking reflects a reduction in the attention paid to the blocked cue. We tested this idea in three experiments in which participants were trained in an associative learning task using a blocking procedure. Attention to stimuli was measured 250 ms after onset using an adapted version of the dot probe task. This task was presented at the beginning of each learning trial (Experiments 1 and 2) or in independent trials (Experiment 3). Results show evidence of reduced attention to blocked stimuli (i.e. “attentional blocking”). In addition, this attentional bias correlated with the magnitude of blocking in associative learning, as measured by predictive-value judgments. Moreover, Experiments 2 and 3 found evidence of an influence of learning about predictiveness on memory for episodes involving stimuli. These findings are consistent with a central role of learned attentional biases in producing the blocking effect, and in the encoding of new memories. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society","Associative learning; attention; blocking; dot probe; memory",,,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002323762

The aims of the current study were to 1) test an attentional retraining procedure in a sample of moderate and heavy cannabis using students and 2) compare baseline attentional and approach bias between the two groups with different implicit measures. Design and participants Attentional bias scores toward cannabis-related or neutral stimuli were determined with modified versions of the Visual Probe Task and the cannabis Stroop task. Approach and avoidance action tendencies toward cannabis-related and neutral stimuli were assessed with the cannabis Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) and the Stimulus Response Compatibility task (SRC). Seventeen participants were assigned randomly to five sessions of an attentional retraining procedure or control training. Results Attentional retraining did not decrease the speeded detection of cannabis stimuli and the difficulty to disengage from those stimuli, no trainingseffects were revealed. Moderate cannabis users did not show an attentional bias for cannabis-related cues (measured with the cannabis Stroop task), whereas heavy cannabis users did show an attentional bias for cannabis-related stimuli that cannot be attributed to cognitive control deficits on the classical Stroop task. Moreover, heavy cannabis users, but not moderate users, were significant faster to approach cannabis images compared to neutral images, using the SRC task. Conclusion Seen the observed difference in cognitive biases towards cannabis stimuli between moderate and heavy cannabis users, this study supports the allegation that cognitive biases towards cannabis stimuli may be an important marker of problematic cannabis use.","Approach bias; Attentional bias; Cannabis; Cognitive bias modification; Retraining","Article; association; attention test; attentional bias; attentional retraining procedure; cannabis smoking; cognitive bias; comparative study; executive function; human; mental task; Stroop test",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010711650

Some cognitive models of anxiety propose that attention bias to threat causes and maintains anxiety. This view led to the development of a computer-delivered treatment: attention bias modification (ABM) which predominantly trains attention avoidance of threat. However, meta-analyses indicate disappointing effectiveness of ABM-threat-avoidance training in reducing anxiety. This article considers how ABM may be improved, based on a review of key ideas from models of anxiety, attention and cognitive control. These are combined into an integrative framework of cognitive functions which support automatic threat evaluation/detection and goal-directed thought and action, which reciprocally influence each other. It considers roles of bottom-up and top-down processes involved in threat-evaluation, orienting and inhibitory control in different manifestations of attention bias (initial orienting, attention maintenance, threat avoidance, threat-distractor interference) and different ABM methods (e.g., ABM-threat-avoidance, ABM-positive-search). The framework has implications for computer-delivered treatments for anxiety. ABM methods which encourage active goal-focused attention-search for positive/nonthreat information and flexible cognitive control across multiple processes (particularly inhibitory control, which supports a positive goal-engagement mode over processing of minor threat cues) may prove more effective in reducing anxiety than ABM-threat-avoidance training which targets a specific bias in spatial orienting to threat. © 2016 The Authors","Anxiety; Attention; Attention bias modification; Cognitive control; Threat","anxiety; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; cognition; executive function; human; meta analysis; model; anxiety; cognition; computer assisted therapy; inhibition (psychology); psychology; teaching; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Avoidance Learning; Cognition; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Teaching; Therapy, Computer-Assisted",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986322596

Study-level meta-analyses of ABM have produced conflicting findings and leave critical questions unresolved regarding ABM's mechanisms of action and clinical potential. We pooled patient-level datasets from randomized controlled trials of children and adults with high-anxiety. Attentional bias (AB) towards threat, the target mechanism of ABM, was tested as an outcome and a mechanistic mediator and moderator of anxiety reduction. Diagnostic remission and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were clinical outcomes available in enough studies to enable pooling. Per-patient data were obtained on at least one outcome from 13/16 eligible studies [86% of eligible participants; n = 778].

There was no main effect of ABM on LSAS. However, moderator analyses suggested ABM was effective for patients who were younger (≤ 37 y), trained in the lab, and/or assessed by clinicians. Under the same conditions where ABM was effective, mechanistic links between AB and anxiety reduction were supported. Under these specific circumstances, ABM reduces anxiety and acts through its target mechanism, supporting ABM's theoretical basis while simultaneously suggesting clinical indications and refinements to improve its currently limited clinical potential. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; Attention Bias Modification; Attention training; Attentional bias; Patient-level meta-analysis","adult; anxiety; attentional bias; child; clinical outcome; controlled study; human; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; mediator; meta analysis; patient coding; randomized controlled trial; remission; theoretical model; anxiety; behavior therapy; computer assisted therapy; procedures; psychology; therapy; treatment outcome; Adult; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Behavior Therapy; Child; Humans; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988914450

This is the first ABM trial to investigate two (vs. one) targets of attention bias within a sample with co-occurring symptoms of social anxiety and alcohol dependence. Additionally, we used trial-level bias scores (TL-BS) to capture the phenomena of attention bias in a more ecologically valid, dynamic way compared to traditional attention bias scores. Method Adult participants (N = 86; 41% Female; 52% African American; 40% White) with elevated social anxiety symptoms and alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to an 8-session training condition in this 2 (Social Anxiety ABM vs. Social Anxiety Control) by 2 (Alcohol ABM vs. Alcohol Control) design. Symptoms of social anxiety, alcohol dependence, and attention bias were assessed across time. Results Multilevel models estimated the trajectories for each measure within individuals, and tested whether these trajectories differed according to the randomized training conditions. Across time, there were significant or trending decreases in all attention TL-BS parameters (but not traditional attention bias scores) and most symptom measures. However, there were not significant differences in the trajectories of change between any ABM and control conditions for any symptom measures. Conclusions These findings add to previous evidence questioning the robustness of ABM and point to the need to extend the effects of ABM to samples that are racially diverse and/or have co-occurring psychopathology. The results also illustrate the potential importance of calculating trial-level attention bias scores rather than only including traditional bias scores. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol dependence; Attention bias modification; Social anxiety","adult; African American; alcoholism; Article; attention bias modification; attentional bias; Caucasian; controlled study; drinking behavior; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; psychotherapy; race difference; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; social phobia; statistical analysis; trial level bias score; alcoholism; ancestry group; attentional bias; complication; middle aged; Phobia, Social; psychology; teaching; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Alcoholism; Attentional Bias; Continental Population Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phobia, Social; Teaching; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","R21AA02151, NIAAA, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism","The authors are thankful for the performance site where this research was conducted, the Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, as well as for the research assistance and staff support provided by Harini Pallerla, E.

This paper examines whether theory and research into the role of information-processing in the underlying psychopathology of paediatric anxiety disorders indicate possibilities for improving treatment response. Using a critical review of recent theoretical, empirical and academic literature, the paper examines the role of information-processing biases in paediatric anxiety disorders, the extent to which CBT targets information-processing biases, and possibilities for improving treatment response. The literature reviewed indicates a role for attentional and interpretational biases in anxious psychopathology. While there is theoretical grounding and limited empirical evidence to indicate that CBT ameliorates interpretational biases, evidence regarding the effects of CBT on attentional biases is mixed. Novel treatment methods including attention bias modification training, attention feedback awareness and control training, and mindfulness-based therapy may hold potential in targeting attentional biases, and thereby in improving treatment response. The integration of novel interventions into an existing evidence-based protocol is a complex issue and faces important challenges with regard to determining the optimal treatment package. Novel interventions targeting information-processing biases may hold potential in improving response to CBT for paediatric anxiety disorders.

Notwithstanding this variability, we found evidence of associations, of medium effect size, between general cognition and treatment adherence, and between reward-based decision-making and relapse. The link between general cognition and treatment adherence is consistent with emerging evidence linking limited cognitive-executive resources with less ability to benefit from talk therapies. The link between reward-based decision-making and relapse accords with decision neuroscience models of addiction.

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify cognitive tasks sensitive to acute abstinence and predictive of smoking cessation success. Methods: Embase, Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science were searched up to March 2016. Studies were included if they enrolled adults and assessed smoking using a quantitative measure. Studies were combined in a random effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 42 acute abstinence studies and 13 cessation studies. There was evidence for an effect of abstinence on delay discounting [d = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07–0.45, P = 0.005], response inhibition (d = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.26–0.70, P < 0.001), mental arithmetic (d = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.06–0.70, P = 0.018), and recognition memory (d = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.23–0.70, P < 0.001). In contrast, performance on the Stroop (d = 0.17, 95% CI = −0.17–0.51, P = 0.333) and smoking Stroop (d = 0.03, 95% CI = −0.11–0.17, P = 0.675) task was not influenced by abstinence. We found only weak evidence for an effect of acute abstinence on dot probe task performance (d = 0.15, 95% CI = −0.01–0.32, P = 0.072). The design of the cessation studies was too heterogeneous to permit meta-analysis. Conclusions: Compared with satiated smokers, acutely abstinent smokers display higher delay discounting, lower response inhibition, impaired arithmetic and recognition memory performance. However, reaction-time measures of cognitive bias appear to be unaffected by acute tobacco abstinence. Conclusions about cognitive tasks that predict smoking cessation success were limited by methodological inconsistencies. © 2016 The Authors.

Although reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy, is known to effectively modulate subjective experience of emotions, it remains unknown whether reappraisal can alter attentional biases to emotional information. In the current research, we investigated the influence of instruction-induced state reappraisal (Study 1) and trait reappraisal (Study 2) on attentional biases to happy and angry faces. In Study 1, healthy young women were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the three groups: up-, down-, and no-regulation. Participants were instructed to reappraise their emotions to increase and decrease emotional experience while viewing an emotionally negative film clip. Attentional bias was assessed with a dot-probe task with pictures of angry and happy facial expressions. In Study 2, a separate group of healthy young men and women participated. Participants' trait reappraisal and suppression as well as state and trait anxiety were assessed. A dot-probe task was completed by all participants. Statistical tests in Study 1 revealed that participants who reappraised to decrease negative emotions while viewing an emotionally negative film clip had reduced attentional bias to subsequently presented angry faces compared to participants who reappraised to increase negative emotions. Multiple regression analyses in Study 2 revealed that trait reappraisal predicted slower orienting toward angry faces, whereas state anxiety predicted slower disengagement from angry faces. Interestingly, trait suppression predicted slower disengagement from happy faces. Taken together, these results suggest that both instruction-induced state reappraisal and trait reappraisal are linked to reduced attentional bias to negative information and contribute to better understanding of how everyday emotion regulation styles contribute to attentional processing of emotional information. © 2016 Kim, Kim and Kim.","Angry face; Attentional bias; Disengagement; Happy face; Orienting; Reappraisal; Suppression",,"MEST, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; NRF-2015R1A2A1A15052283, NAS, National Academy of Sciences, Republic of Korea; NRF, National Research Foundation of Korea","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grants funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea (Nos.

Computerized attention bias modification (ABM) trainings may have the potential to be provided as cost-effective intervention as adjunct to usual care (UC), by speeding up recovery and bringing more patients into remission. Research suggests, that a selective attention for negative information contributes to development and maintenance of depression and that reducing this negative bias might be of therapeutic value. Previous ABM studies in depression, however, have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of long-term follow-up measures or focus on sub-clinical samples. This study aims at evaluating the long-term (cost-) effectiveness of internet-based ABM, as add-on treatment to UC in adult outpatients with MDD, in a specialized mental health care setting. Methods/design: This study presents a double-blind randomized controlled trial in two parallel groups with follow-ups at 1, 6, and 12 months, combined with an economic evaluation. One hundred twenty six patients, diagnosed with MDD, who are registered for specialized outpatient services at a mental health care organization in the Netherlands, are randomized into either a positive training (towards positive and away from negative stimuli) or a sham training, as control condition (continuous attentional bias assessment). Patients complete eight training sessions (seven at home) during a period of two weeks (four weekly sessions). Primary outcome measures are change in attentional bias (pre- to post-test), mood response to stress (at post-test) and long-term effects on depressive symptoms (up to 1-year follow-up). Secondary outcome measures include rumination, resilience, positive and negative affect, and transfer to other cognitive measures (i.e., attentional bias for verbal stimuli, cognitive control, positive mental imagery), as well as quality of life and costs. Discussion: This is the first study investigating the long-term effects of ABM in adult outpatients with MDD, alongside an economic evaluation. Next to exploring the mechanism underlying ABM effects, this study provides first insight into the effects of combining ABM and UC and the potential implementation of ABM in clinical practice.

Specifically, we highlight how maintenance of a clear distinction between process and procedure serves to enhance the advancement of knowledge and understanding, while failure to maintain this distinction can foster confusion and misconception. We show how such clear differentiation has permitted the continuous refinement of assessment procedures, in ways that have led to growing confidence in the existence of the putative attentional bias process of interest, and also increasing understanding of its nature. In contrast, we show how a failure to consistently differentiate between process and procedure has contributed to confusion concerning whether or not attentional bias modification reliably alters anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. As we demonstrate, such confusion can be avoided by distinguishing the process of attentional bias modification from the procedures that have been employed with the intention of evoking this target process. Such an approach reveals that procedures adopted with the intention of eliciting the attentional bias modification process do not always do so, but that successful evocation of the attentional bias modification process quite reliably alters anxiety symptomatology. We consider some of the specific implications for future research concerning attentional bias modification, while also pointing to the broader implications for experimental psychopathology research in general. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Attentional bias modification; Experimental psychopathology; Procedures; Process","alertness; anxiety; anxiety assessment; Article; attentional bias; attentional bias modification; behavior modification; depression; experimental mental disease; generalized anxiety disorder; human; nonhuman; obsessive compulsive disorder; panic; posttraumatic stress disorder; social phobia; Stroop test; threat; transcranial direct current stimulation; anxiety; behavioral research; mental disease; procedures; psychology; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Behavioral Research; Humans; Psychopathology",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992208879

Most clinical trials of ABMT have focused on adults or small samples of youth. The current randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines ABMT efficacy in youth with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and tests possible moderators of treatment outcomes. Method: Sixty-seven youth with SAD were randomly assigned to ABMT or attention control training (ACT) conditions. Anxiety severity was measured at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. ClinicalTrials.gov name and identifier: Attention bias modification treatment for children with social anxiety, NCT01397032; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Results: Both ABMT and ACT induced significant reductions in clinician and self-rated social anxiety (ps <.001). An additional reduction was observed at the 3-month follow-up in clinician-rated anxiety symptoms (p =.03). Moderation effects were nonsignificant for the clinician-rated anxiety outcome, but age moderated self-reported anxiety. Older but not younger children, showed significant reduction in anxiety following ABMT relative to ACT (p <.001). Individual differences in attention control also moderated ABMT's effect on self-reported anxiety (p =.05). Children rated by their parents as lower on attention control benefited more from ABMT than those rated higher on attention control. Baseline attention bias did not moderate anxiety (p =.17). Conclusions: Despite significant reductions in social anxiety, no specific evidence for ABMT was found relative to a control condition. Age and attention control moderated ABMT effects on self-reported SAD symptoms, with clinical effects for older relative to younger children and for those with lower attention control. These results highlight the need to consider developmental influences in the implementation of ABMT protocols. © 2016 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Adolescence; anxiety; attention; treatment trials","adolescent; attentional bias; child; controlled study; female; human; male; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; Phobia, Social; physiology; randomized controlled trial; Adolescent; Attentional Bias; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Phobia, Social",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978829295

Methods: The final sample consisted of 41 girls at familial risk for depression, who were randomly assigned to receive six sessions (864 trials) of real or sham attention bias training [Real attentional bias training (ABT) vs. Sham ABT]. Participants who received Real ABT completed a modified dot-probe task designed to train attention toward positive and away from negative facial expressions; in contrast, girls who received Sham ABT completed the standard dot-probe task. Attentional biases, self-reported mood, and psychophysiological responses to stress were measured at pre- and post-training assessments. Results: As expected, girls who received Real ABT, but not those who received Sham ABT, exhibited significant increases from pre- to post-training in their attention toward happy faces and away from sad faces. Moreover, adolescents who received Real ABT were buffered against the negative outcomes experienced by adolescents who received Sham ABT. Specifically, only adolescents who received Sham ABT experienced an increase in negative mood and a pre- to post-training increase in heart rate in anticipation of the stressor. Conclusions: The current findings provide the first experimental evidence that attentional biases can be modified in youth at risk for depression and further suggest that ABT modulates the heightened response to stress that is otherwise experienced by high-risk adolescents. © 2016 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","adolescents; Attention bias modification; depression","adolescent; attentional bias; child; child psychology; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; experimental model; facial expression; female; girl; heart rate; human; mood; psychiatry; randomized controlled trial; stress; attentional bias; controlled study; Depressive Disorder, Major; facial expression; outcome assessment; physiology; procedures; psychotherapy; Adolescent; Attentional Bias; Depressive Disorder, Major; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Psychotherapy","22337, NARSAD, National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression; BBRF, Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health; F32-MH102013, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health","This research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) grants F32-MH102013 (JL), F32-MH096385 (KK), and MH74849 (IHG), the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD; Young Investigator Award 22337 to JL and Distinguished Investigator Award to IHG).

We undertook a cross-sectional study assessing attentional biases to alcohol-, depression-, and anxiety- related stimuli using the visual probe task in patients with alcohol dependence, attending a community alcohol service. Methods: Using the visual probe task, we presented disorder-specific words (relating to alcohol, anxiety, and depression) for 500 ms and measured reaction times. Results: Participants demonstrated a significant attentional bias towards alcohol-related cues (mean 8.5, p = 0.03) but significant avoidance of depression-related cues (mean −8.4, p = 0.01). The subgroup of participants who were recently abstinent (n = 70) showed greatest avoidance of depression-related cues (t(69) = 2.68, p < 0.01) but no significant vigilance towards alcohol or anxiety cues, whereas those still drinking (n = 43) showed attentional biases towards alcohol-related (t(42) = 2.70, p = 0.01) and social anxiety-related cues (t(42) = 2.84, p < 0.01). In the whole sample, the magnitude of attentional bias to alcohol was not correlated with length of drinking history, number of comorbid conditions, or severity of anxiety/depression. Conclusions: In a clinical sample of alcohol-dependent patients, further investigation is required to explore whether these attentional biases reflect current drinking status or factors indicating prognosis.

However, few studies have explored the role of attentional bias on driving behavior. This study assessed drivers’ attentional bias towards safety-related words (ABS) using the dot-probe paradigm and self-reported daily driving behaviors. The results revealed significant negative correlations between attentional bias scores and several indicators of dangerous driving. Drivers with fewer dangerous driving behaviors showed greater ABS.

We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias. Method Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching. Results ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias. Conclusion Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic. © 2016 Kruijt et al.

A pictorial dot-probe task assessed AB toward pain stimuli (ie, pain faces cueing pain), after which participants performed the physical tasks. Participants also rated face stimuli in terms of pain, sadness, and anger expression. As hypothesized, perceived injustice was positively associated with AB toward pain stimuli; additionally, perceived injustice and AB were positively associated with appraisals of pain and difficulty. Counter to expectations, AB did not mediate the relationship between perceived injustice and task appraisals, suggesting that AB is insufficient to explain this relationship. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants with higher levels of perceived injustice rated stimulus faces as sadder and angrier; no such differences emerged for pain ratings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between perceived injustice and AB toward pain, as well as perceived injustice and in vivo appraisals of common physical activity. Results extend existing literature and suggest that attentional and potential interpretive bias should be considered in future research.

We suggest that attention can be biased towards stimuli that are associated with instructions for tasks that will be performed in the future even if those tasks have not yet been experienced. We performed two experiments in which participants receive instructions in which some objects were associated with a response (i.e., instructed S-R objects; “Experiment 1”) or a stimulus property (i.e., instructed S-S objects; “Experiment 2”), whereas control objects were not. However, before participants were required to perform the S-R task (“Experiment 1”) or perform an S-S memory task (“Experiment 2”), they performed a visual probe task in which target objects and control objects served as irrelevant cues. Our results show that attention was biased towards the S-R objects (compared to control stimuli) but not to S-S objects. These findings suggest that future plans can bias attention toward specific stimuli, but only when these stimuli are associated with a specific action. We discuss these findings in light of research concerning automatic effects of instructions and theories that view attention as a selection-for-action mechanism. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"adult; association; attention; cognition; female; human; male; physiology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938704235

Studies based on self-report measures suggest negative illness representations, related symptom interpretations, and heightened symptom focusing are maintaining factors of fatigue. This study reviews studies which have investigated these cognitive biases using experimental methods, to (1) review the evidence for information processing biases in CFS; (2) determine the nature of these biases, that is the stages cognitive biases occur and for what type of stimuli; and (3) provide directions for future methodologies in this area. Methods: Studies were included that measured attention and interpretation bias towards negative and illness-related information in people with CFS and in a comparison group of healthy controls. PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and EThOS were searched until December 2014. Results: The evidence for cognitive biases was dependent on the methodology employed as well as the type and duration of the stimuli presented. Modified Stroop studies found weak evidence of an attentional bias in CFS populations, whereas visual-probe studies consistently found an attentional bias in CFS groups for health-threatening information presented for 500 ms or longer. Interpretative bias studies which required elaborative processing, as opposed to a spontaneous response, found an illness-related interpretive bias in the CFS group compared to controls. Conclusions: Some people with CFS have biases in the way they attend to and interpret somatic information. Such cognitive processing biases may maintain illness beliefs and symptoms in people with CFS. This review highlights methodological issues in experimental design and makes recommendations to aid future research to forge a consistent approach in cognitive processing research. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Studies based on self-report measures suggest negative illness representations, related symptom interpretations, and heightened symptom focusing contribute to the maintenance of chronic fatigue. Experimental studies in other clinical populations, such as patients with anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, have identified illness-specific biases in how information is implicitly attended to and interpreted, which has a causal role in these conditions. What does this study add? This is the first review of implicit cognitive processes in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Sustained attention and negative interpretations of somatic information may reinforce negative illness beliefs. Cognitive processes have a role to play in the cognitive behavioural model of CFS. © 2016 The British Psychological Society","attentional bias; chronic fatigue syndrome; cognitive behavioural model; illness representations; information processing; interpretive bias; symptom interpretation",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990838706

Attention bias modification (ABM) aims to reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders by directly modifying this deficit. However, existing ABM training programs have not consistently modified attentional bias and may not reflect optimal learning needs of participants (i.e., lack of explicit instruction, training goal unclear to participants, lack of feedback, non-adaptive, inability to differentiate or target different components of attentional bias). In the current study, we introduce a new adaptive ABM program (AABM) and test its feasibility in individuals with social anxiety disorder. We report task characteristics and preliminary evidence that this task consistently modifies attentional bias and that changes in attentional bias (but not number of trials) correlate with the level of symptom reduction.

This study tested the theoretical prediction that emotional attention bias is linked to reappraisal of negative emotion-eliciting stimuli and subsequent emotional responding using a novel attentional control training. Thirty-six undergraduates were randomly assigned to either the control or the attention training condition and were provided with different task instructions while they performed an interpretation task. Whereas control participants freely created interpretations, participants in the training condition were instructed to allocate attention toward positive words to efficiently create positive interpretations (i.e., recruiting attentional control) while they were provided with gaze-contingent feedback on their viewing behavior. Transfer to attention bias and reappraisal success was evaluated using a dot-probe task and an emotion regulation task which were administered before and after the training. The training condition was effective at increasing attentional control and resulted in beneficial effects on the transfer tasks. Analyses supported a serial indirect effect with larger attentional control acquisition in the training condition leading to negative attention bias reduction, in turn predicting greater reappraisal success which reduced negative emotions. Our results indicate that attentional mechanisms influence the use of reappraisal strategies and its impact on negative emotions. The novel attention training highlights the importance of tailored feedback to train attentional control.

Attentional biases in response to threat-related cues, linked to both early experience and psychopathology, may explain this association. To date, however, no study has examined attentional biases to fearful facial expressions as a function of early life stress or examined these biases as a potential mediator of the relation between early life stress and social problems. Methods: In a sample of 154 children (ages 9–13 years) we examined the associations among interpersonal early life stressors (i.e., birth through age 6 years), attentional biases to emotional facial expressions using a dot-probe task, and social functioning on the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: High levels of early life stress were associated with both greater levels of social problems and an attentional bias away from fearful facial expressions, even after accounting for stressors occurring in later childhood. No biases were found for happy or sad facial expressions as a function of early life stress. Finally, attentional biases to fearful faces mediated the association between early life stress and social problems.

Yet, empirical evidence for individual differences (e.g., in restrained eating and body mass index) in attention bias for food is mixed. We tested experimentally if temporarily induced health versus palatability mindsets influenced attention bias for food, and whether restrained eating moderated this relation. After manipulating mindset (health vs. palatability) experimentally, food-related attention bias was measured by eye-movements (EM) and response latencies (RL) during a visual probe task depicting high-calorie food and non-food. Restrained eating was assessed afterwards. A significant interaction of mindset and restrained eating on RL bias emerged, β = 0.36, t(58) = 2.05, p = 0.045: A health mindset - as compared to a palatability mindset - attenuated attention bias for high-caloric food only in participants with higher eating restraint. No effects were observed on EM biases. The current results demonstrate that state differences in health versus palatability mindsets can cause attenuated attention bias for high-calorie food cues in participants with higher eating restraint.

Results: The subclinical group showed attentional bias toward happy faces; past use of problem-focused coping strategies when dealing with a personally relevant stressor as well as state levels of anxiety, together, contributed to this bias. In the control group, the happy attentional bias was positively correlated with activity in the right caudate.

To date, the most effective psychological treatments for individuals who binge eat are not effective for all patients and they do not result in significant weight loss. Dual process theories suggest that implicit factors, such as attention bias, may influence behavior, even when the behavior is in opposition to long-term goals. Attention bias modification programs have been tested in other areas of psychopathology, and could be utilized to improve outcomes for people who binge eat. Thus, the aim of this open trial was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of an attention bias modification program (ABM-Food) designed to train attention away from food cues. Methods Adults who binge eat and were overweight or obese enrolled in an 8-week ABM-Food program, which consisted of one session in the lab each week and two training sessions at home. Nine participants completed the ABM-Food training program and the post-treatment assessment, and 8 completed the 3-month post-treatment assessment. Results: Results showed that the ABM-Food program is a feasible and acceptable treatment for adults who binge eat. Initial effectiveness data showed decreases in weight, eating disorder symptoms, binge eating, loss of control and responsivity to food in the environment, as well as changes in attention bias. The majority of these effects remained at the 3-month follow-up time point. Limitations This study is limited by the single-group open label trial, and the small sample size. Conclusions This open trial provides initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of ABM-Food for individuals who binge eat and are overweight or obese. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Attention bias; Attention bias modification; Binge eating; Obesity; Overeating; Weight loss","adult; Article; association; attentional bias; binge eating disorder; clinical article; female; follow up; human; male; obesity; open study; symptom; training; weight reduction; anthropometry; attentional bias; bulimia; cognitive therapy; complication; middle aged; Overweight; physiology; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; self report; treatment outcome; Adult; Anthropometry; Attentional Bias; Bulimia; Cognitive Therapy; Cues; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964284845

However, no randomised controlled trial has examined ABMT effects on anxiety in a real-world fear-provoking context. The current study examined the immediate effects of ABMT in reducing state anxiety among healthy participants awaiting dental treatment. Method: Seventy-one healthy participants seeking treatment in a dental clinic were randomly assigned to either (1) Dental ABMT; (2) Attention Control Condition (ACC); or (3) Neutral Distraction. The study used a modified dot-probe task consisting of dental and neutral words. In the ABMT condition, participants were trained to shift attention away from the dental words, whereas in the ACC, the same stimuli were presented, but attention was not trained in any specific direction. The Neutral Distraction task consisted of a casual video game. State anxiety was measured before and after completing the tasks while in the dentist's waiting room and immediately following the dental treatment. Results: Results indicated a significant interaction between time and condition on anxiety levels. The Neutral Distraction group showed a significant reduction in anxiety levels from pre- to post-task (before dental treatment), but neither the ABMT nor the ACC group showed this trend. Following dental treatment, only the ACC group demonstrated a decrease in anxiety levels, while no change was reported by either the ABMT or the Neutral Distraction group. Conclusion: Findings from this exploratory study suggest that distraction tasks have a better immediate effect than ABMT in alleviating state anxiety in non-anxious individuals who are expecting a relatively unpleasant experience. ï¿½ 2016 The Australian Psychological Society","attention bias modification treatment; dental anxiety; non-clinical population; RCT; threat-related attention biases",,"1377/14, ISF, Israel Science Foundation","This research was supported by the Marie Curie Career Integration Grant (PCIG13-GA-2013-618534) and the Israel Science Foundation grant (1377/14).",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969884494

Attention bias modification training (ABMT), a computerized intervention, is thought to mitigate stress-related symptoms by targeting disruptions in threat monitoring. We examined the efficacy of ABMT delivered before combat in mitigating risk for PTSD following combat. Method We conducted a double-blind, four-Arm randomized controlled trial of 719 infantry soldiers to compare the efficacy of eight sessions of ABMT (n = 179), four sessions of ABMT (n = 184), four sessions of attention control training (ACT; n = 180), or no-training control (n = 176). Outcome symptoms were measured at baseline, 6-month follow-up, 10 days following combat exposure, and 4 months following combat. Primary outcome was PTSD prevalence 4 months post-combat determined in a clinical interview using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms, collected at all four assessments. Results PTSD prevalence 4 months post-combat was 7.8% in the no-training control group, 6.7% with eight-session ABMT, 2.6% with four-session ABMT, and 5% with ACT. Four sessions of ABMT reduced risk for PTSD relative to the no-training condition (odds ratio 3.13, 95% confidence interval 1.01-9.22, p < 0.05, number needed to treat = 19.2). No other between-group differences were found. The results were consistent across a variety of analytic techniques and data imputation approaches. Conclusions Four sessions of ABMT, delivered prior to combat deployment, mitigated PTSD risk following combat exposure. Given its low cost and high scalability potential, and observed number needed to treat, research into larger-scale applications is warranted. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01723215.

The former involves an unusually strong tendency to behaviourally avoid spiders, whereas the latter involves unusually strong growth of state anxiety as proximity to a spider increases. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate whether biased attentional responding to spider information causally contributes to the behavioural symptoms of spider fear. The findings of these studies suggest that such bias may not causally underpin the behavioural symptoms of spider fear. However, no study has yet examined whether attentional bias to spider information influences the emotional symptoms of spider fear. This was the purpose of this study. Method: Participants were exposed to an attentional bias modification (ABM) procedure, configured to induce either a decrease (avoid spider training) or an increase (attend spider training) in attentional bias to spider information, and then required to approach a live spider. The impact of this ABM training on the behavioural (how close participants approached the spider), and emotional symptoms (rate of growth in state anxiety as proximity to the spider increased), of spider fear was assessed. Results: The induction of a group difference in attentional bias to spider information influenced the degree to which state anxiety became elevated as proximity to a spider increased, but not patterns of behavioural approach to a spider. Conclusions: These results suggest that attentional bias to spider information causally contribute to the emotional component of spider fear, but may not functionally underpin the behavioural component of spider fear. © 2016 The Australian Psychological Society","attentional bias; attentional bias modification; behavioural approach to spider; emotional responding to spider; spider fear",,"DP140103713; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045","This work was supported by Australian Research Council Grants DP140104448 and DP140103713, and by a grant from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS?UEFISCDI, project number PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983042871

Attention bias modification (ABM) is a cognitive intervention designed to improve depression by decreasing negative attentional bias, but to date its efficacy has been inconclusive. Adjunctive neuroenhancement to augment clinical effectiveness has shown promise, particularly for individuals who respond positively to the primary intervention. Objective/hypothesis This randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-principle study is the first to test the hypothesis that augmentative LLLT will improve the effects of ABM among adults with elevated symptoms of depression. Methods Fifty-one adult participants with elevated symptoms of depression received ABM before and after laser stimulation and were randomized to one of three conditions: right forehead, left forehead, or sham. Participants repeated LLLT two days later and were assessed for depression symptoms one and two weeks later. Results A significant three-way interaction between LLLT condition, ABM response, and time indicated that right LLLT led to greater symptom improvement among participants whose attention was responsive to ABM (i.e., attention was directed away from negative stimuli). Minimal change in depression was observed in the left and sham LLLT. Conclusions The beneficial effects of ABM on depression symptoms may be enhanced when paired with adjunctive interventions such as right prefrontal LLLT; however, cognitive response to ABM likely moderates the impact of neuroenhancement. The results suggest that larger clinical trials examining the efficacy of using photoneuromodulation to augment cognitive training are warranted. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Attention bias modification; Brain stimulation; Cognition; Depression; Lasers; Photobiomodulation","alprazolam; amfebutamone; antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; fluoxetine; lamotrigine; mood stabilizer; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adult; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; depression; female; forehead; human; low level laser therapy; major clinical study; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; adolescent; attention; depression; Depressive Disorder; low level laser therapy; neuropsychological test; physiology; procedures; psychology; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Attention; Attentional Bias; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Low-Level Light Therapy; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","R21MH092430, NIH, National Institutes of Health; University of Texas at Austin; R01DA032457, NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant R21MH092430 to CGB) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (grant R01DA032457 to CGB).

Methods Using a dot-probe paradigm, we investigated whether temperament traits and gender, which are linked to (sub)clinical symptoms and attentional processing, influenced attentional biases in healthy adults. Results All participants showed protective attentional biases in terms of orienting their attention away from negative information. In both genders higher values of negative affect were compensated with stronger attentional engagement with positive stimuli. This effect was more pronounced in men than in women. Effortful control fulfilled its regulative function in terms of stronger avoidance of negative stimuli only among men. Limitations Reaction times after probe detection provide only a snapshot of attention and allow only for an indirect assessment of visual attention. Future research should emphasize methods that allow for continuous monitoring of attention allocation, therefore results of the present study await replication in psychophysiological or eye-tracking studies.

Stress modulates social cognition through cortisol, which acts on glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the brain. Objectives: We examined the role of MR activation on attentional bias toward emotional cues and on emotion recognition. Methods: We included 40 healthy young women and 40 healthy young men (mean age 23.9 ± 3.3), who either received 0.4 mg of the MR agonist fludrocortisone or placebo. A dot-probe paradigm was used to test for attentional biases toward emotional cues (happy and sad faces). Moreover, we used a facial emotion recognition task to investigate the ability to recognize emotional valence (anger and sadness) from facial expression in four graded categories of emotional intensity (20, 30, 40, and 80 %). Results: In the emotional dot-probe task, we found a main effect of treatment and a treatment × valence interaction. Post hoc analyses revealed an attentional bias away from sad faces after placebo intake and a shift in selective attention toward sad faces compared to placebo. We found no attentional bias toward happy faces after fludrocortisone or placebo intake. In the facial emotion recognition task, there was no main effect of treatment. Conclusions: MR stimulation seems to be important in modulating quick, automatic emotional processing, i.e., a shift in selective attention toward negative emotional cues. Our results confirm and extend previous findings of MR function. However, we did not find an effect of MR stimulation on emotion recognition. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cortisol; Emotion recognition; Fludrocortisone; Mineralocorticoid receptor; Selective attention; Stress","fludrocortisone; mineralocorticoid receptor; fludrocortisone; mineralocorticoid receptor; adult; anger; Article; association; attentional bias; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; emotionality; facial expression; female; happiness; heart rate; human; human experiment; hydrocortisone release; male; mental task; mineralocorticoid receptor stimulation; nerve stimulation; normal human; priority journal; recognition; sadness; selective attention; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; task performance; agonists; attention; drug effects; emotion; face; facial recognition; perception; young adult; Adult; Anger; Attention; Cues; Emotions; Face; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Fludrocortisone; Happiness; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; Social Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978880223

Twenty-four male chewers' and 23 male nonchewers' eye movements to betel-quid-related pictures and matched pictures were assessed during a visual probe task. The eye movement index showed that betel quid chewers were more likely to initially direct their gaze to the betel quid cues, t(23) = 3.70, p &lt; .01, d = .75, and spent more time, F(1, 23) = 4.58, p &lt; .05, ηp 2 = .17, and were more fixated, F(1, 23) = 5.18, p &lt; .05, ηp 2 = .18, on them.

This study examines prospective relations among attention bias, trauma exposure, and anxiety and trauma symptoms in a sample previously reported to manifest cross-sectional associations between attention bias and observed anxiety at preschool age. Methods: Young children [mean (MN) = 5.0, ±0.7 years, n = 208] from a community-based sample completed the dot-probe task to assess their attention biases in response to angry faces. At baseline (T1) and at follow-up approximately 9 months later (T2), anxiety and trauma exposure (i.e. violent and noninterpersonal events) and symptoms were assessed by maternal report. Results: Neither attention bias nor baseline or recent trauma exposure predicted later anxiety. In contrast, attention bias toward threat and recent trauma exposure significantly predicted later trauma symptoms. There was evidence of symptom specificity such that attention bias toward threat significantly predicted hyperarousal and dissociation, but not avoidance or re-experiencing symptoms. Finally, moderation analyses indicated that the relationship between attention bias and trauma symptoms may differ according to children's experiences of probable abuse. Conclusions: Attention profiles and trauma exposure may increase the risk that young children will develop trauma symptoms.

It is hypothesized that pain experience would induce stronger attentional bias and such bias could be suppressed by the motivation to avoid impeding pain. Methods: All participants took part in visual-probe tasks with pictures and words as stimuli that are typically used in studies of attentional bias. They were allocated to three groups: no-pain (NP) group, performing tasks without experiencing pain; pain-experience (PE) group, performing the same tasks following painful stimuli; and pain-experience-with-motivation (PEM) group, undergoing the same procedure as PE group with additional instructions about avoiding impeding pain. Eye movements were recorded during the tasks. Results: The eye movement data showed that: (1) participants in the PE group exhibited stronger attention bias towards painful pictures than those in the NP group; (2) the attentional bias towards painful pictures was significantly reduced in the PEM group as compared to the PE group. By contrast, the verbal task failed to find these effects using sensory pain words as stimuli. Conclusion: This study was the first that revealed the impact of acute experimental pain on attentional bias towards pain-related information in healthy individuals through eye tracking. It may provide a possible solution to reduce hypervigilance towards pain-related information by altering the motivational relevance. What does this study add?: (1) This study revealed the impact of experimental pain on attentional bias in healthy individuals; (2) This study may provide a possible approach of altering motivational relevance to control the pain-induced attentional bias towards pain-related information. © 2016 European Pain Federation - EFIC®",,"adult; Article; attentional bias; experimental pain; eye movement; eye tracking; female; human; human experiment; male; motivation; normal human; orienting response; pain; pain threshold; priority journal; response time; sensory stimulation; verbal behavior; young adult; anxiety; association; avoidance behavior; eye movement; psychology; Acute Pain; Adult; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Avoidance Learning; Cues; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959872244

Moreover, cognitive biases, such as attentional and approach biases, have repeatedly been associated with alcohol use. This study aimed to test whether nondependent drinkers display cognitive biases for social alcohol-related (SA) pictures and whether these biases are associated with alcohol use in social drinking contexts. Methods: The visual dot probe task and stimulus–response compatibility tasks were used to measure attentional and approach biases for alcohol-related pictures at baseline. Event-level alcohol use was measured using Ecological Momentary Assessments via personal smartphones. One hundred and ninety-two young adults (51.6% men; Mage = 20.73) completed the study, resulting in 11,257 assessments conducted on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings for 5 consecutive weeks. Results: While no overall attentional bias for alcohol-related pictures was found, young adults showed an approach bias for both social and nonsocial alcohol-related pictures. Multilevel models revealed no direct association between cognitive biases for alcohol-related pictures and alcohol use. However, higher levels of attentional bias for SA pictures were associated with more drinking when individuals were surrounded by a greater number of friends of opposite gender. Higher levels of an approach bias for SA pictures were associated with more drinking in women surrounded by a greater number of friends of the same gender. Conclusions: In a nondependent sample, cognitive biases for SA pictures could not be associated with drinking directly. However, a cognitive bias for SA pictures moderated the association between alcohol use and number of friends present. As most observed effects were gender and situation specific, replication of these effects is warranted.

Neurocognitive models suggest that humans have evolved mechanisms that operate without awareness and prioritize threatening stimuli over neutral stimuli in subsequent perception. In this meta-analysis, we review evidence for this 'standard hypothesis' emanating from 3 widely used, but rather different experimental paradigms that have been used to manipulate awareness. We found a small pooled threat-bias effect in the masked visual probe paradigm, a medium effect in the binocular rivalry paradigm and highly inconsistent effects in the breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm. Substantial heterogeneity was explained by the stimulus type: the only threat stimuli that were robustly prioritized across all 3 paradigms were fearful faces. Meta regression revealed that anxiety may modulate threat-biases, but only under specific presentation conditions. We also found that insufficiently rigorous awareness measures, inadequate control of response biases and low level confounds may undermine claims of genuine unconscious threat processing. Considering the data together, we suggest that uncritical acceptance of the standard hypothesis is premature: current behavioral evidence for threat-sensitive visual processing that operates without awareness is weak. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Awareness; Meta-analysis; Suppression; Threat","anxiety; awareness; ego development; facial expression; facial recognition; fear; human; meta analysis; statistical bias; vision; Anxiety; Awareness; Bias (Epidemiology); Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Fear; Humans; Unconscious (Psychology); Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964545015

The mechanisms underlying cigarette smoking in cocaine-using individuals need to be identified to promote cigarette and cocaine abstinence. Previous studies have examined the salience of cigarette and cocaine cues separately. The present aim was to determine whether cigarette attentional bias (AB) is higher in cigarettes smokers who smoke cocaine relative to individuals who only smoke cigarettes. Methods: Twenty cigarette smokers who smoke cocaine and 20 non-cocaine-using cigarette smokers completed a visual probe task with eye-tracking technology. During this task, the magnitude of cigarette and cocaine AB was assessed through orienting bias, fixation time, and response time. Results: Cocaine users displayed an orienting bias towards cigarette cues. Cocaine users also endorsed a more urgent desire to smoke to relieve negative affect associated with cigarette craving than non-cocaine users (g = 0.6). Neither group displayed a cigarette AB, as measured by fixation time. Cocaine users, but not non-cocaine users, displayed a cocaine AB as measured by orienting bias (g = 2.0) and fixation time (g = 1.2). There were no significant effects for response time data. Conclusions: Cocaine-smoking cigarettes smokers display an initial orienting bias toward cigarette cues, but not sustained cigarette AB. The incentive motivation underlying cigarette smoking also differs. Cocaine smokers report more urgent desire to smoke to relieve negative affect. Identifying differences in motivation to smoke cigarettes may provide new treatment targets for cigarette and cocaine use disorders. Implications: These results suggest that cocaine-smoking cigarette smokers display an initial orienting bias towards cigarette cues, but not sustained attention towards cigarette cues, relative to non-cocaine-using smokers. Smoked cocaine users also report a more urgent desire to smoke to relieve negative affect than non-cocaine users. Identifying differences in motivation to smoke cigarettes may provide new treatment targets for both cigarette and cocaine use disorders. © The Author 2016.

However, because facial expressions are routinely decoded and understood during social communication, sociality should also be considered-that is, it seems necessary to explore whether emotional contextual effects are influenced by the sociality of contextual information. Furthermore, although one behavioral study has explored the effects of context on selective attention to faces, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, the current study investigated how valence and sociality of contextual information influenced the early and later stages of neutral face processing. We first employed an established affective learning procedure, wherein neutral faces were paired with verbal information that differed in valence (negative, neutral) and sociality (social, non-social), to manipulate contextual information. Then, to explore the effects of context on face perception, participants performed a face perception task, while the N170, early posterior negativity (EPN), and late positive potential (LPP) components were measured. Finally, to explore the effects of context on selective attention, participants performed a dot probe task while the N2pc was recorded. The results showed that, in the face perception task, faces paired with negative social information elicited greater EPN and LPP than did faces paired with neutral social information; no differences existed between faces paired with negative and neutral non-social information. In the dot probe task, faces paired with negative social information elicited a more negative N2pc amplitude (indicating attentional bias) than did faces paired with neutral social information; the N2pc did not differ between faces paired with negative and neutral non-social information. Together, these results suggest that contextual information influenced both face perception and selective attention, and these context effects were governed by the interaction between valence and sociality of contextual information. ï¿½ 2016 Xu, Li, Diao, Fan and Yang.","Context effects; EPN; Face processing; LPP; N2pc",,"71472156, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China; SWU1509110","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71472156), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU1509110).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988596781

This study used eye-tracking technology, a measure of visual attention, to evaluate the attentional patterns of individuals with and without chronic pain during exposure to injury-related and neutral pictures. Individuals with (N=51) and without chronic pain (N=62) completed a dot-probe task using injury-related and neutral pictures while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-design analysis of variance evaluated the interaction between group (chronic pain, pain-free) and picture type (injury-related, neutral). Reaction time results showed that regardless of chronic pain status, participants responded faster to trials with neutral stimuli in comparison to trials that included injury-related pictures. Eye-tracking measures showed within-group differences whereby injury-related pictures received more frequent fixations and visits, as well as longer average visit durations. Between-group differences showed that individuals with chronic pain had fewer fixations and shorter average visit durations for all stimuli. An examination of how biases change over the time-course of stimulus presentation showed that during the late phase of attention, individuals with chronic pain had longer average gaze durations on injury pictures relative to pain-free individuals. The results show the advantage of incorporating eye-tracking methodology when examining attentional biases, and suggest future avenues of research. © 2016 Fashler and Katz.","Attentional biases; Avoidance; Chronic pain; Dot probe; Hypervigilance","adult; African; alertness; Article; Asian; attentional bias; Caucasian; chronic pain; controlled study; disease duration; ethnic difference; eye tracking; female; human; major clinical study; male; response time; sex difference; visual evoked potential; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983343781

Those trained towards affective pain words were found to have a greater pain threshold but also greater distress at tolerance. However, mechanisms of change could not be established, as ABM did not affect attentional or interpretation bias, even though changes in attentional bias were associated with pain outcomes.

Smoking-related cognitions (e.g., self-efficacy and intention to quit) and cognitive biases (i.e., attentional and approach bias) for smoking-cues were assessed before training (pretest). Primary outcome-variable was continued abstinence, 6 months after baseline. Bias reduction at the posttraining assessment was the secondary outcome. A 2 × 2 mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression analyses were conducted using the whole sample (N = 434) as well as subsamples of light to moderate smokers (<15 cigarettes, N = 115) and heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes, N = 319). Conservative analyses (coding drop-outs as smokers) as well as complete case analyses were conducted.RESULTS: The ABM training had no significant effect regarding bias reduction and no behavioral effects in the whole sample of smokers. Subsample analyses revealed a significant positive effect on continued abstinence in heavy smokers only (complete case analyses: odds ratio [OR] = 3.15; p = .02; confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-7.99; conservative analyses: OR = 2.49; p = .02; CI = 1.13-5.48).CONCLUSION: Web-based ABM training is ineffective in fostering cognitive bias reduction and continued smoking abstinence.

However, behavioral studies on amygdala-damaged patients have given inconsistent results-variously reporting decreased, persisted, and increased attention towards threat. Here we aimed to characterize the impact of developmental amygdala damage on emotion perception and the nature and time-course of spatial attentional bias towards fearful faces. We investigated SF, a 14-year-old with selective bilateral amygdala damage due to Urbach-Wiethe disease (UWD), and ten healthy controls. Participants completed a fear sensitivity questionnaire, facial expression classification task, and dot-probe task with fearful or neutral faces for spatial cueing. Three cue durations were used to assess the time-course of attentional bias. SF expressed significantly lower fear sensitivity, and showed a selective impairment in classifying fearful facial expressions. Despite this impairment in fear recognition, very brief (100 msec) fearful cues could orient SF's spatial attention. In healthy controls, the attentional bias emerged later and persisted longer. SF's attentional bias was due solely to facilitated engagement to fear, while controls showed the typical phenomenon of difficulty in disengaging from fear. Our study is the first to demonstrate the separable effects of amygdala damage on engagement and disengagement of spatial attention. The findings indicate that multiple mechanisms contribute in biasing attention towards fear, which vary in their timing and dependence on amygdala integrity. It seems that the amygdala is not essential for rapid attention to emotion, but probably has a role in assessment of biological relevance. © 2016 The Authors.","Amygdala; Dot-probe; Emotional processing; Spatial attention; Urbach-Wiethe disease","adolescent; amygdala; amygdala damage; Article; attentional bias; brain damage; case report; controlled study; emotion; facial expression; fear; female; human; lipoid proteinosis; questionnaire; adult; attentional bias; face; facial expression; fear; injuries; male; pathophysiology; physiology; Adult; Amygdala; Attentional Bias; Face; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Lipoid Proteinosis of Urbach and Wiethe; Male","Wellcome Trust; 091593, Core; 309865 NEUROCODEC, ERC, H2020 European Research Council; 91-01-3017196, TUMS, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services; 095939, Wellcome Trust","The authors would like to thank SF and her family for their cooperation and the Tazkieh High School for assistance in recruiting the control subjects.

Attention bias has been studied extensively in social anxiety disorder (SAD) but relatively little in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), historically considered an anxiety disorder, or anorexia nervosa (AN), which is often characterized by interpersonal as well as body image/eating fears. Methods: Medication-free adults with SAD (n = 43), OCD (n = 50), or AN (n = 30), and healthy control volunteers (HC, n = 74) were evaluated for attention bias with an established dot probe task presenting images of angry and neutral faces. Additional outcomes included attention bias variability (ABV), which summarizes fluctuation in attention between vigilance and avoidance, and has been reported to have superior reliability. We hypothesized that attention bias would be elevated in SAD and associated with SAD severity. Results: Attention bias in each disorder did not differ from HC, but within the SAD group attention bias correlated significantly with severity of social avoidance. ABV was significantly lower in OCD versus HC, and it correlated positively with severity of OCD symptoms within the OCD group. Conclusions: Findings do not support differences from HC in attention bias to threat faces for SAD, OCD, or AN.

However, empirical study of AB among remitted depressed patients is limited in scope and has yielded mixed findings. Mixed findings may be accounted for by how the field has conceptualized and thereby studied AB. We propose that a novel temporal dynamic process perspective on AB may help disambiguate extant findings and elucidate the nature of AB in remitted depression. Thus, we reexamined Dot Probe data among remitted depressed patients (RMD; n = 328) and nondepressed controls (NDC; n = 82) that previously yielded null effects when AB was quantified by means of the traditional aggregated mean bias score (Vrijsen et al., 2014). We reanalyzed data using a novel computational approach that extracts a series of bias estimations from trial to trial (Zvielli, Bernstein, & Koster, 2015). Key features of these dynamic process signals revealed moderate to excellent reliability relative to the traditional aggregated mean bias scores. These features of AB dynamics-specifically temporal variability in AB including AB toward and away from emotional stimuli-were significantly elevated among RMDs relative to NDCs. Moreover, among RMDs, a greater number of past depressive episodes were associated with elevation in these features of AB dynamics. Effects were not accounted for by residual depressive symptoms or social anxiety symptoms. Findings indicate that dysregulation in attentional processing of emotional information reflected in AB dynamics may be key to depression vulnerability. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Attentional bias; Depression; Dynamics; Major depressive disorder; Remitted depression","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; depression; depression assessment; disease predisposition; DSM-IV; emotion; facial expression; female; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; remission; social behavior; test retest reliability; emotion; major depression; middle aged; psychology; reproducibility; statistical analysis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Attentional Bias; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Depressive Disorder, Major; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989301348

The present study examined whether the opioid-related bias operates in early attention processes such as initial orienting, or in maintained attention, or both. Evidence from prior research is limited and mixed. The time course of attentional bias for drug cues was assessed using a dot-probe task with pictorial drug cues presented at 3 stimulus exposure durations: 200, 500 and 1,500 ms. There were 2 groups: opioid-dependent (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 20). Individuals in the opioid-dependent group were recruited from community drug and alcohol treatment services; 95% were taking methadone. Compared with the control group, the opioid-dependent group showed a significant attentional bias for opioid-related information presented at 200 ms (p =.006). There was a similar trend at 500 ms which was nonsignificant (p =.057), and no bias at 1,500 ms (p =.698). The findings indicate an attentional bias to drug cues in opioid dependence, which operates in initial orienting processes, but not maintained attention.

However, no research has compared the relationship between attention indices (i.e., vigilance-avoidance, difficulty disengaging from threat) and characteristic features of the disorder such as fear during social situations (social fear) and avoidant behaviors (social avoidance). Method To address this issue, seventy adults (19.29±1.47 years, 33 females) were separated into low (n=37) or high (n=33) socially anxious groups using clinical cutoff scores on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Participants in both groups completed a dot-probe task with congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials to obtain measures of vigilance-avoidance and difficulty disengaging. Using linear regression, we examined the associations each attention index shared with self-reported social fear and social avoidance. Results Exclusively in the high anxious group, greater vigilance towards threat was associated with higher self-reported social fear, but not with social avoidance. However, difficulty disengaging was not associated with either social measure. In the low anxiety group, no relationships between attention indices and either social measure emerged. Limitations Future research with clinical samples is necessary to replicate and extend these findings. The small sample size studied may have limited our ability to detect other smaller effects.

Reduction of bias may ultimately reduce use. Objective: The current study examined whether attentional bias modification therapy (ABMT) reduced the frequency of drug use behaviors in individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Method: Participants (n = 37) were randomly assigned to ABMT or control therapy, which systematically varied how frequently probes replaced neutral (ABMT = 100%; control therapy = 50%) relative to drug stimuli. Each intervention included 5 training sessions comprising a total of 2640 trials over 4 weeks. Clinical assessments occurred at baseline, post-intervention, 2 weeks and 3 months posttreatment. Results: There were no baseline differences between groups on drug-use behaviors or other clinical measures. Contrary to predictions, both groups exhibited slower rather than faster reaction times for cocaine stimuli (p = 0.005) at baseline, with no relationship between bias and baseline measures of drug-use behavior. Conclusions: ABMT was not more effective than our control therapy at reducing attentional bias, reducing craving or changing other drug use behaviors. Current results suggest additional replication studies are needed to assess ABMT’s efficacy in reducing drug-use behaviors in CUD. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","attentional bias modification; Cocaine; craving; therapy","cocaine; adult; Article; attentional bias; attentional bias modification therapy; behavior; clinical article; clinical assessment; cocaine dependence; cognitive therapy; controlled study; drug use; female; human; male; prediction; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; training; behavior therapy; Behavior, Addictive; Cocaine-Related Disorders; young adult; Adult; Attentional Bias; Behavior Therapy; Behavior, Addictive; Cocaine-Related Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,"This research was supported by a grant [grant number NIH 01 R21 DA031380] from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Andrew Mayer.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969174926

Whether these attentional shifts constitute epiphenomena or are critically linked to the calculation process is still unknown. In the present study, we investigate participants’ performance on addition and subtraction solving while they have to detect central or lateralized targets. The results show that lateralized distractors presented in the hemifield congruent to the operation to be solved interfere with arithmetical solving: participants are slower to solve subtractions or additions when distractors are located on the left or on the right, respectively. These results converge with previous data to show that attentional shifts underlie not only number processing but also mental arithmetic. They extend them as they reveal the reverse effect of the one previously reported by showing that inducing attention shifts interferes with the solving of arithmetic problems. They also demonstrate that spatial attentional shifts are part of the calculation procedure of solving mentally arithmetic problems.

Empirical evidence though is inconsistent. Some studies report associations between AB towards, threat and PTS; other studies report associations between AB away from threat and PTS; yet other studies fail to find any association. We propose that prospective–longitudinal study of AB as a dynamic process, expressed from moment to moment in time, may help to understand these mixed findings and the role of AB in PTS. Methods: We tested cross-sectional and prospective–longitudinal associations between AB and PTS among German soldiers from pre- to post-deployment in Afghanistan (n = 144). AB to threat and positive emotion stimuli (angry/happy faces) was measured using the dot-probe task. PTS was assessed by the PTSD Checklist. The number of traumatic experiences was assessed using CIDI-traumatic experience lists for military. Results: We found that AB dynamics (i.e., towards, away, temporal variability) at pre- and post-deployment, with respect to angry and happy faces, predicted higher levels of PTS after deployment as a function of number of intermediate traumatic experiences. Traditional aggregated mean bias scores did not similarly prospectively predict PTS post deployment. Conclusions: Findings indicate that AB to emotionally arousing stimuli may play an important function in the development and maintenance of PTS. We argue that mixed and null findings appear to be due to failure to model the within-subject temporal variability in AB expression.

Participants were 6–12 years old (at screening) typically developing children participating in the High Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders (n = 1280; 606 girls, 674 boys). Children were stratified according to maternal emotional disorder (none; mood disorder; anxiety disorder; comorbid anxiety/mood disorder) and gender. Attention biases were assessed using a dot-probe paradigm with threat, happy and neutral faces. A significant gender-by-parental emotional disorder interaction predicted threat bias, independent of anxiety and depression symptoms in children. Daughters of mothers with an emotional disorder showed increased attention to threat compared with daughters of disorder-free mothers, irrespective of the type of maternal emotion disorder. In contrast, attention bias to threat in boys only occurred in mothers with a non-comorbid mood disorder. No group differences were found for biases for happy-face cues. Gender and type of maternal emotional disorder predict attention bias in disorder-free children.

Moreover, by adopting a variety of two-dimensional size illusions induced by pictorial depth cues (e.g., the Ponzo illusion), previous studies have revealed that the perceived, rather than the retinal, size of an object determines its detection. It remains unclear, however, whether and how the retinal versus perceived size of a cue influences the process of attentional orienting to subsequent targets, and whether the corresponding influencing processes differ between two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) space. In the present study, we incorporated the dot probe paradigm with either a 2-D Ponzo illusion, induced by pictorial depth cues, or a virtual 3-D world in which the Ponzo illusion turned into visual reality. By varying the retinal size of the cue while keeping its perceived size constant (Exp. 1), we found that a cue with smaller retinal size significantly facilitated attentional orienting as compared to a cue with larger retinal size, and that the effects were comparable between 2-D and 3-D displays. Furthermore, when the pictorial background was removed and the cue display was positioned in either the farther or the closer depth plane (Exp. 2), or when both the depth and the background were removed (Exp. 3), the retinal size, rather than the depth, of the cue still affected attentional orienting. Taken together, our results suggest that the retinal size of a cue plays the crucial role in the visuospatial orienting of attention in both 2-D and 3-D. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Attentional orienting; Perceived size; Ponzo illusion; Retinal size; Three-dimensional (3-D)","adult; association; attention; depth perception; female; human; illusion; male; orientation; perception; physiology; young adult; Adult; Attention; Cues; Depth Perception; Female; Humans; Illusions; Male; Orientation; Size Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961841660

The effects on social anxiety did not differ between the two ABMs. This study suggests that although both ABMs using short and long stimulus durations reduce some aspects of social anxiety, they influence participants' attentional disengagement in different ways. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Attention bias modification; Attentional bias; Attentional training; Social anxiety","adult; anxiety; Article; attention; attention bias modification; attention disturbance; attention test; attentional bias; clinical effectiveness; cognitive therapy; controlled study; female; human; latent period; male; negative feedback; placebo effect; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; response time; subclinical social anxiety; therapy effect; young adult; adolescent; anxiety; attention; attentional bias; cognitive therapy; defense mechanism; depression; facial expression; fear; Phobia, Social; physiology; procedures; psychological rating scale; psychology; Taiwan; time factor; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Attention; Attentional Bias; Cognitive Therapy; Depression; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Negativism; Phobia, Social; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult","NSC 100-2420−H-004-031-DR, NSC, National Science Council","This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC 100-2420−H-004-031-DR ), awarded to Chi-Wen Liang.

However, heterogeneity of extant findings suggests that it may be informative to elucidate individual difference factors that modulate the processing of emotional information. The current study examined whether individual differences in components of attentional control (AC - shifting and focusing) moderated the link between social anxiety and attentional engagement and disengagement biases for threat-relevant cues. Methods Seventy-five undergraduate students completed well-established measures of social anxiety symptoms, AC, and attentional bias for social threat information (modified probe detection task). Results Moderation analyses revealed that at low levels of AC-shifting, increased social anxiety was associated with slower disengagement from threat-relevant compared to neutral social cues. In contrast, at high levels of AC-shifting, social anxiety was associated with faster disengagement from threat-relevant compared to neutral stimuli. Individual differences in AC-focusing did not moderate the social anxiety-attentional bias link. Limitations Causal inferences cannot be made given the cross-sectional study design. The sample comprised individuals displaying a range of self-reported social anxiety symptoms; thus, generalizability to clinical samples remains to be established. The measurement of AC relied on subjective participant report.

Although early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety proneness more than control procedures lacking a contingency between cues and probes, recent work suggests that the latter performed just as well as the former did. In this experiment, we investigated a non-emotional mechanism that may play a role in ABM. Methods We randomly assigned 62 individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of social anxiety disorder to a single-session of a non-emotional contingency training, non-emotional no-contingency training, or control condition controlling for potential practice effects. Working memory capacity and anxiety reactivity to a speech challenge were assessed before and after training. Results Consistent with the hypothesis of a practice effect, the three groups likewise reported indistinguishably significant improvement in self-report and behavioral measures of speech anxiety as well as in working memory. Repeating the speech task twice may have had anxioltyic benefits. Limitations The temporal separation between baseline and post-training assessment as well as the scope of the training sessions could be extended. Conclusions The current findings are at odds with the hypothesis that the presence of visuospatial contingency between non-emotional cues and probes produces anxiolytic benefits. They also show the importance of including a credible additional condition controlling for practice effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention bias modification; Cognitive bias modification; Executive control; Social anxiety disorder; Speech anxiety; Visuospatial contingency","adult; anxiety; Article; association; attentional bias; controlled study; depth perception; double blind procedure; DSM-IV; emotion; executive function; female; human; major clinical study; male; randomized controlled trial; self report; social phobia; speech; working memory; young adult; attention; emotion; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; Phobic Disorders; physiology; procedures; psychotherapy; verbal behavior; Adult; Attention; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Phobic Disorders; Psychotherapy; Verbal Behavior; Young Adult","FNRS, Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS","This research was supported by post-doctoral grant (FC78142) from the Belgian National Foundation for Scientific Research “F.R.S. - FNRS” (awarded to Alexandre Heeren).

Social anxiety is supposedly associated with an attentional bias towards disorder related stimuli such as threatening faces. Using the facial dot probe task in socially anxious individuals has, however, revealed inconsistent findings. Methods The current systematic review aims at disentangling the heterogeneous findings using effect sizes across results by systematically taking into account potential moderating variables (stimulus type, stimulus duration, situational anxiety, disorder severity). Results Results provide some evidence that socially anxious individuals preferentially allocate their attention towards threat faces compared to non-anxious controls. This bias seems to depend on the type of reference stimulus, stimulus duration and clinical level of social anxiety. Avoidance of threat was neither found at early, nor at later stages of attentional processing. Limitations Importantly, the results have to be considered in the light of the only few studies available. Given the heterogeneity of results and some methodological restrictions of the studies included, the picture of attentional bias seems to be much less clear than suggested in the recent social anxiety literature. Conclusions Methodologically, combined measures of dot-probe and eye movement measures might be beneficial to detect overt attentional biases. Importantly, our results show that preferential processing of threat cues might guide early attentional processes in social anxiety, depending however on several contextual and situational factors. Clinically, patients with greater severity of SAD may be more prone to such an attentional bias, thus therapists should take this into account when planning behavioral experiments and exposure therapy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An influential model of perfectionism, put forward by Shafran, Cooper, and Fairburn (2002), proposes that high perfectionism reflects an attentional bias that operates to afford greater attention to negative information than to positive information, when this information is perfectionism-relevant. The present study is the first to experimentally test this hypothesis. Method The present study assessed the type of stimuli that high perfectionists (n = 31) preferentially attend to compared to low perfectionists (n = 25) within a non-clinical population. Using an attentional probe task, we compared high and low perfectionist attentional responding to stimulus words that differed in terms of their emotional valence (positive vs. negative) and perfectionism-relevance (perfectionism-relevant vs. -irrelevant). Results Analysis revealed that, unlike low perfectionists, high perfectionists displayed greater attentional preference to negative than to positive information, but only for perfectionism-relevant stimuli. Limitations The implications must be considered within the limitations of the present study. The present study did not assess clinical participants, as such conclusions cannot be made regarding attentional bias that characterize clinical disorders in which perfectionism is identified as a predisposing and perpetuating factor. Conclusions Theoretically, the attentional dot-probe task lends weight to the cognitive-behavioral model of clinical perfectionism, which proposed a biased attentional processing of negative perfectionism relevant stimuli within perfectionism. This conclusion was previously based on clinical impressions, whereas the present study used an objective performance measure. Clinically, therapists should take this attentional bias into account when planning treatments that involve targeting perfectionism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, data are lacking on the possible existence of an attentional bias in response to academic stressors, and whether variables related to school well-being (SWB) and students' individual characteristics may influence such attentional patterns. Aim: We aimed to investigate whether students show an attentional bias for school-related stressors. We sought to identify groups of students who differ in their perceived SWB, and to test whether they display different attention allocation patterns. We also examined whether negative emotionality moderates the expected association between students' SWB and attentional bias. Methods: Eighth-grade students completed a dot-probe detection task to register attentional patterns towards or away from an academic threatening word. SWB in terms of school anxiety, school-based stress, and perceived class climate was also assessed via self-reports. In addition, participants reported on their negative emotionality. Results: The results indicated that students showed an attentional bias towards words describing academic stressors. Cluster analyses allowed the identification of two groups of students with high versus low SWB. Regression analysis indicated that those with low SWB were more likely to show a greater bias and that negative emotionality moderated this relationship. Specifically, within the context of low SWB, students with high negative emotionality were more prone to biased attention towards school-related stressors compared with students with low negative emotionality. Conclusions: The present data indicate a perceptual bias for the detection of academic threats. Within the school practice, teachers should promote SWB and devote specific attention to students with high negative emotionality to reduce a biased allocation of attention in response to school-related stressors. © 2016 The British Psychological Society.","Attentional bias; Eight graders; Negative emotionality; School well-being; School-related stress","adolescent; attentional bias; emotion; female; human; male; mental stress; physiology; psychology; satisfaction; school; student; Adolescent; Attentional Bias; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Schools; Stress, Psychological; Students",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954304500

Over time, many children with BI increasingly fear social circumstances and display maladaptive social behavior. BI is also one of the strongest individual risk factors for developing social anxiety disorder. Although research has established a link between BI and anxiety, its causal mechanism remains unclear. Attention biases may underlie this relation. The current study examined neural markers of the BI-attention-anxiety link in children ages 9-12 years (N = 99, Mean = 9.97, SD = 0.97). ERP measures were collected as children completed an attention-bias (dot-probe) task with neutral and angry faces. P2 and N2 amplitudes were associated with social anxiety and attention bias, respectively. Specifically, augmented P2 was related to decreased symptoms of social anxiety and moderated the relation between BI and social anxiety, suggesting that increasing attention mobilization may serve as a compensatory mechanism that attenuates social anxiety in individuals with high BI. The BI by N2 interaction found that larger N2 related to threat avoidance with increasing levels of BI, consistent with over-controlled socio-emotional functioning. Lastly, children without BI (BN) showed an augmented P1 to probes replacing angry faces, suggesting maintenance of attentional resources in threat-related contexts. © 2016 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Attention bias; Behavioral inhibition; Dot-probe; ERP; Temperament","anger; Article; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; behavior control; child; child psychiatry; disease association; disgust; electroencephalography; event related potential; fear; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental task; nerve cell network; priority journal; psychologic assessment; scoring system; social phobia; task performance; temperament; threat; adult; anxiety; attentional bias; child behavior; cross-sectional study; emotion; inhibition (psychology); pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; visual evoked potential; Adult; Anxiety; Attentional Bias; Child; Child Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Fear; Female; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Temperament","BRAINS R01 MH094633, NIH, National Institutes of Health; Social Science Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University","This work is supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health [BRAINS R01 MH094633] to KPE.

A dot-probe task with four presentation durations was used to capture both subliminal and supraliminal stages of processing. Task stimuli consisted of neutral and threat images. Attentional control (AC) was examined as a moderator of the relationship between PTSD and ABV. At an experimental session, participants (PTSD=11, trauma control=18) completed questionnaires, a modified dot-probe task, and a stimulus-response task measuring AC. Individuals in the PTSD group exhibited greater ABV compared to trauma control participants. AC moderated this relationship, with participants with PTSD and poorACexhibiting significantly greater ABV than trauma-exposed control participants with poor AC. These effects remained significant after accounting for traditionally calculated ABT scores and variability on trials for which only neutral stimuli were present, thus ensuring that the observed effects were specific to the presence of threat stimuli and not merely a function of general variability in response times.

Previous research demonstrates that cannabis use is associated with dysfunctional affect regulation and anxiety. Anxiety is characterised by attentional biases in the presence of emotional information. This novel study therefore examined the attentional bias of cannabis users when presented with anxiety-related stimuli. The aim was to establish whether cannabis users respond to anxiety-related stimuli differently to control participants. Methods: A dot-probe paradigm was utilised using undergraduate students. Trials contained anxiety-related stimuli and neutral control stimuli. Eye-tracking was used to measure attention for the stimuli. Results: Results indicated that cannabis users demonstrated attentional-avoidance behaviour when presented with anxiety-related stimuli. Conclusions: The findings suggest a difference in processing of emotional information in relation to neutral information between groups. It would appear that cannabis users avoid anxiety provoking stimuli. Such behaviour could potentially have motivational properties that could lead to exacerbating anxiety disorder-type behaviour. © 2016.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Cannabis","cannabis; adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; anxiety related stimuli; Article; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; cannabis use; clinical article; eye movement; eye tracking; female; human; male; regulatory mechanism; stimulus; undergraduate student; young adult","EPSRC, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","TW is supported in part by a grant from the EPSRC .

However, the robustness and nature of these cognitive biases are unclear. The aims of this study were to conduct a systematic literature search and perform a critical synthesis of studies examining the relationship between cognitive biases toward body image-related stimuli and body image concerns. Our review identified 32 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Dot-probe, Stroop, free recall, and eye-tracking were among the most frequently used paradigms. The extant literature provides robust support for the presence of attention biases toward body image-related stimuli among individuals with high levels of body dissatisfaction compared to those with lower levels of concerns. Evidence was also found for the existence of judgment biases and memory biases. Furthermore, results suggest that body image-related cognitive biases, and levels of body dissatisfaction can be manipulated. Initial evidence was also found for differential patterns of biases toward ""fat"" and ""thin"" stimuli. These findings confirm the importance of considering cognitive biases within etiological models of body image concerns and suggest that these processes might provide novel treatment targets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention bias; Body dissatisfaction; Body image; Cognitive; Judgment; Memory; Review","attentional bias; body image; cognitive bias; eye tracking; human; memory bias; model; recall; stimulus; systematic review; attentional bias; cognition; decision making; emotion; memory; psychology; satisfaction; Attentional Bias; Body Image; Cognition; Emotions; Humans; Judgment; Memory; Personal Satisfaction",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963831901

Among the various features of a fearful face, the eyes appear to be particularly important for recognizing and responding to these social cues. One way in which fearful faces facilitate observers’ behavior is by automatically capturing attention. This is true for both consciously and nonconsciously processed fearful faces. Recent research suggests that consciously processed fearful eyes alone are sufficient to capture observers’ attention. However, it is unknown as to whether or not nonconsciously processed, backward masked, fearful eyes are sufficient to facilitate spatial attention. To test this possibility, two dot-probe experiments with masked fearful eye stimuli were performed. In Experiment 1, we found that, relative to scrambled eyes, masked fearful eyes facilitate attentional orienting and delay attentional disengagement. In Experiment 2, we replicated this effect when comparing backward masked fearful to neutral eyes. Thus, the data suggest that nonconscious fearful eyes facilitate spatial attention through facilitated orienting and delayed disengagement. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Attention bias; Backward masking; Facial expressions; Non-verbal communication; Social perception; Threat bias",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957548582

We propose that vigilance-avoidance patterns will become evident in anxious youth through a focus on individual differences and real-world strategic avoidance. Decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) could play a mechanistic role in this link. 78 clinically anxious youth completed a dot-probe task to assess vigilance to threat while undergoing fMRI. Real-world avoidance was assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of self-reported suppression and distraction during negative life events. Vigilance toward threat was positively associated with EMA distraction and suppression. Functional connectivity between a right amygdala seed region and dorsomedial and right dorsolateral PFC regions was inversely related to EMA distraction. Dorsolateral PFC-amygdalar connectivity statistically mediated the relationship between attentional vigilance and real-world distraction. Findings suggest anxious youth showing attentional vigilance toward threat are more likely to use suppression and distraction to regulate negative emotions. Reduced PFC control over limbic reactivity is a possible neural substrate of this pattern. These findings lend ecological validity to laboratory vigilance assessments and suggest PFC-amygdalar connectivity is a neural mechanism bridging laboratory and naturalistic contexts. © 2016 The Authors","Anxiety; Attention; Emotion regulation; Imaging; Information processing","alertness; amygdala; anxiety; Article; attention; avoidance behavior; brain function; child; connectome; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; DSM-IV; Ecological Momentary Assessment; emotionality; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; generalized anxiety disorder; human; life event; limbic system; major clinical study; male; nervous system function; neuropsychological test; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; school child; separation anxiety; social phobia; adolescent; arousal; avoidance behavior; ecological momentary assessment; emotion; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; predictive value; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; Adolescent; Amygdala; Anxiety; Arousal; Attention; Avoidance Learning; Child; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Emotions; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Photic Stimulation; Predictive Value of Tests; Prefrontal Cortex; Psychomotor Performance","MH080215, NIH, National Institutes of Health; MH018269, NIH, National Institutes of Health; MH082998, NIH, National Institutes of Health; K23MH100259, NIH, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants MH080215 , MH082998 , K23MH100259 , and MH018269 .

Here, we investigated the functional role of temporal binding between the visual and the tactile senses. To this end we used the paradigm of compression that induces shifts in time when probe stimuli are degraded, e.g., by a visual mask (Zimmermann et al. 2014). Subjects had to estimate the duration of temporal intervals of 500 ms defined by a tactile and a visual, masked stimulus. We observed a strong (∼100 ms) underestimation of the temporal interval when the stimuli from both senses appeared to occur at the same position in space. In contrast, when the positions of the visual and tactile stimuli were spatially separate, interval perception was almost veridical. Temporal compression furthermore depended on the correspondence of probe features and was absent when the orientation of the tactile and visual probes was incongruent. An additional experiment revealed that temporal compression also occurs when objects were presented outside the attentional focus. In conclusion, these data support a role for spatiotemporal binding in temporal compression, which is at least in part selective for object features.",,"chemical binding; compression; DNA probe; human; stimulus; touch; writing",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975263703

However, the optimal parameters for stimulation and underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. Psychiatric treatments have acute effects on emotional processing that predict later therapeutic action. Such effects have been proposed as cognitive biomarkers for screening novel treatments for depression and anxiety. Methods This study assessed the effect of tDCS on a battery of emotional processing measures sensitive to antidepressant action. To refine optimal stimulation parameters, DLPFC stimulation using two common electrode montages was compared with sham. Sixty healthy volunteers received 20 minutes of active or sham DLPFC stimulation before completing computerized emotional processing tasks, including a dot-probe measure of vigilance to threat. Results Relative to sham stimulation, participants receiving simultaneous anodal stimulation of left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC (bipolar-balanced montage) showed reduced vigilance to threatening stimuli. There was no such significant effect when the cathode was placed on the supraorbital ridge (bipolar-unbalanced montage). There were no effects of tDCS on other measures of emotional processing. Conclusions Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that modulating activity in the DLPFC reduces vigilance to threatening stimuli. This significant reduction in fear vigilance is similar to that seen with anxiolytic treatments in the same cognitive paradigm. The finding that DLPFC tDCS acutely alters the processing of threatening information suggests a potential cognitive mechanism that could underwrite treatment effects in clinical populations. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Anxiety; Cognitive biases; Depression; Emotional processing; Noninvasive brain stimulation; tDCS","adult; alertness; anxiety; Article; cognition; controlled study; depression; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; double blind procedure; emotion; female; human; human experiment; male; neuromodulation; normal human; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stimulus response; transcranial direct current stimulation; treatment indication; adolescent; analysis of variance; anxiety; attention; depression; emotion; frontal lobe; middle aged; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; questionnaire; reaction time; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Attention; Depression; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult","Lundbeckfonden","MI is supported by a Medical Research Council studentship and research support grant.

We recorded the brain activity of 20 participants (12 women) while they were exposed to a probe visual stimulus in three different conditions: executing a task on the visual probe (externally oriented attention), and two conditions involving inward-turned attention i.e. generating inner speech and performing visual imagery. Event-related potentials results showed that the P1 amplitude, related with sensory response, was significantly attenuated during both task involving inward attention compared with external task. When both representational formats were compared, the visual imagery condition showed stronger attenuation in sensory processing than inner speech condition. Alpha power in visual areas was measured as an index of cortical inhibition. Larger alpha amplitude was found when participants engaged in an internal thought contrasted with the external task, with visual imagery showing even more alpha power than inner speech condition.

However, very few studies investigate how chewing betel nut affects cognition. This chapter reviews the studies regarding attentional biases in addictive behaviors in general and in betel nut chewers in particular. The visual probe task is commonly employed to measure attentional bias toward substance cues. In a typical visual probe task, participants need to respond to a visual probe presented immediately after the offset of a pair of substance-related stimuli. Critically, one of the stimuli is related to the addictive substance. The presentation durations of the pictures are manipulated to investigate different phases of attentional processing. By using this task, Ho, Chang, Li, and Tang (2013) show that heavy chewers exhibited the initial orienting (200. ms) and maintained attentional (2000. ms) bias toward betel nut cues.

We tested whether the early automatic allocation of spatial attention reflects these sexual attractions. The dot-probe task was used to assess whether spatial attention was attracted to images of either male or female models that were naked or partially clothed. In Experiment 1, men were faster if the target appeared after the female stimulus, whereas women were equally quick to respond to targets after male or female stimuli. In Experiment 2, neutral cues were introduced. Men were again faster to female images in comparison to male or neutral images, but showed no bias on the male versus neutral test. Women were faster to both male and female pictures in comparison to neutral pictures. However, in this experiment they were also faster to female pictures than to male pictures. The results suggest that early attentional processes reveal category-specific interest to the preferred sexual category for heterosexual men, and suggest that heterosexual women do not have category-specific guidance of attentional mechanisms.

Impulsivity, along with willingness and intentions to drink in the future, were assessed in a pretest session. In the experimental sessions, adolescents viewed a series of clips that showed drinking associated with either positive outcomes (e.g., social facilitation) or negative outcomes (fights, arguments). A third group viewed clips with similar positive or negative outcomes, but no alcohol consumption. All participants then responded to an implicit measure of attentional bias regarding alcohol (a dot probe), followed by explicit alcohol measures (self-reports of willingness and intentions to drink). Hypotheses, based on dual-processing theories, were: (a) highimpulsive adolescents would respond more favorably than low-impulsive adolescents to the positive clips, but not the negative clips; and (b) this difference in reactions to the positive clips would be larger on the willingness than the intention measures. Results supported the hypotheses: Adolescents high in impulsivity reported the highest willingness to drink in the positive-clip condition, but were slightly less willing than others in the negative-clip condition. In addition, results on the dot probe task indicated that RTs to alcohol words were negatively correlated with changes in alcohol willingness, but not intention; that is, the faster their response to the alcohol words, the more their willingness increased.

They monitored intrusive memories during baseline, suppression, and think anything phases. The impact of suppression and load on self-reported intrusions, attention bias (dot-probe), and memory priming (word-stem task) was assessed. The ASD load group were less able to suppress memories (d = 0.32, CI95 [-0.15, 0.83], p = .088) than the ASD no load group (d = 0.63, CI95 [0.08, 1.24], p &lt; .001).

No consistent findings were observed in relation to attentional bias. ASD load individuals exhibited stronger priming responses for motor vehicle accident and assault words than all other groups (ds between 0.35-0.73). Working memory did not moderate any outcomes of interest. The findings indicate that cognitive load interferes with suppression and may enhance access to trauma memories and associated material.

Undisturbed recognition and processing of facial emotions are basic prerequisites for smooth social interactions. Intranasal application of the neuropeptide oxytocin has been reported to enhance emotion recognition in neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy individuals. We therefore investigated whether oxytocin modulates attention to emotional faces in patients with chronic depression. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study, 43 patients received a single dose of oxytocin or placebo nasal spray and were tested while fulfilling a facial dot probe task. We assessed reaction times to neutral probes presented at the location of one of two faces depicting happy, angry, or neutral expressions as a prime. Results: When comparing reaction times to the congruent (prime and probe at the same location) with incongruent presentation of facial emotions, neither the placebo nor oxytocin group showed an attentional preference for emotional facial expressions in terms of a threat bias. However, oxytocin treatment did reveal two specific effects: it generally reduced the allocation of attention towards angry facial expressions, and it increased sustained attention towards happy faces, specifically under conditions of heightened awareness, i.e. trials with longer primes. Conclusions: We investigated a heterogeneous group of medicated male and female patients. We conclude that oxytocin does modulate basic factors of facial emotion processing in chronic depression. Our findings encourage further investigations assessing the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in chronic depression. Trial registration:EUDRA-CT 2010-020956-69.

Humans tend to be biased toward emotional images, especially when the emotion is of a threatening nature. Bonobos have rich, social emotional lives and are known for their soft and friendly character. In the present study, we investigated (i) whether bonobos, similar to humans, have an attentional bias toward emotional scenes compared with conspecifics showing a neutral expression, and (ii) which emotional behaviors attract their attention the most. As predicted, results consistently showed that bonobos' attention was biased toward the location of the emotional versus neutral scene. Interestingly, their attention was grabbed most by images showing conspecifics such as sexual behavior, yawning, or grooming, and not as much-as is often observed in humans-by signs of distress or aggression. The results suggest that protective and affiliative behaviors are pivotal in bonobo society and therefore attract immediate attention in this species.","Affect; Ape; Attention; Bonobo; Empathy","aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; distress syndrome; emotion; female; grooming; male; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; priority journal; sexual behavior; yawning; animal; attention; human; Pan paniscus; physiology; psychology; reaction time; social behavior; Animals; Attention; Behavior, Animal; Emotions; Female; Humans; Pan paniscus; Reaction Time; Social Behavior",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962450000

Ninety adults diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and 81 controls with no lifetime mood disorder underwent a positive mood induction and then completed an emotion face dot-probe task; participants in the bipolar disorder group also completed a self-report measure of responses to positive affect. Attentional bias was not related to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or to symptom severity.

Method Resting-state functional MRI was used to explore the effects of ABM training on subthreshold depression (SubD) and corresponding spontaneous brain activity changes. Participants were 41 young women with SubD and 26 matched non-depressed controls. Participants with SubD were randomized to receive either ABM or placebo training during 28 sessions across 4 weeks. Non-depressed controls were assessed before training only. Attentional bias, depressive severity, and spontaneous brain activity before and after training were assessed in both training groups. Results Findings revealed that compared to active control training, ABM training significantly decreased depression symptoms, and increased attention for positive stimuli. Resting-state data found that ABM training significantly reduced amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the right anterior insula (AI) and right middle frontal gyrus which showed greater ALFF than non-depressed controls before training; Functional connectivity strength between right AI and the right frontoinsular and right supramarginal gyrus were significantly decreased after training within the ABM group; moreover, the improvement of depression symptoms following ABM significantly correlated with the connectivity strength reductions between right AI and right frontoinsular and right supramarginal gyrus. Conclusion These results suggest that ABM has the potential to reshape the abnormal patterns of spontaneous brain activity in relevant neural circuits associated with depression.

The present trial examined effects of ABM on adolescent depression. Method A total of 45 adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD), selected from a school population (n = 2,731) using a 2-stage case-finding procedure, were randomized to an active ABM intervention (n = 23) or placebo ABM training (n = 22). In the active condition, participants completed a neutral ABM over 2 weeks for 8 sessions (320 trials each) to shift attention away from sad words to neutral words. At a 9-week follow-up, they received a positive ABM for 2 weeks with 4 more sessions (480 trials each), shifting attention to positive words. The placebo training used the same tasks but shifted attention toward neutral and sad words equally often. Attentional biases and clinical status determined by semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were obtained before and after each training. Depressive symptoms were reassessed at 8- and 12-month follow-ups. Results Greater reductions in attentional bias score and clinician-rated depressive symptoms were found for active ABM compared with placebo after initial neutral ABM. More participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for MDD in active ABM than in placebo. Greater reductions in self-reported depressive and anxious symptoms at the 12-month follow-up were also found in active ABM compared with placebo. Conclusion ABM may be a potential treatment tool for mild to moderate adolescent major depression.

The diagnostic criteria are based on those for Substance Use Disorder and Gambling Disorder. Excessive gamblers and persons with Substance Use Disorder show attentional biases towards stimuli related to their addictions. We investigated whether excessive Internet gamers show a similar attentional bias, by using two established experimental paradigms. Methods: We measured reaction times of excessive Internet gamers and non-gamers (N = 51, 23.7 ± 2.7 years) by using an addiction Stroop with computerrelated and neutral words, as well as a visual probe with computer-related and neutral pictures. Mixed design analyses of variance with the between-subjects factor group (gamer/non-gamer) and the within-subjects factor stimulus type (computer-related/neutral) were calculated for the reaction times as well as for valence and familiarity ratings of the stimulus material. Results: In the addiction Stroop, an interaction for group × word type was found: Only gamers showed longer reaction times to computer-related words compared to neutral words, thus exhibiting an attentional bias. In the visual probe, no differences in reaction time between computer-related and neutral pictures were found in either group, but the gamers were faster overall. Conclusions: An attentional bias towards computer-related stimuli was found in excessive Internet gamers, by using an addiction Stroop but not by using a visual probe. A possible explanation for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the visual probe may have been too easy for the gamers. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Addiction Stroop; Attentional bias; Internet gaming disorder; MMORPG; Visual probe","addiction stroop; adult; Article; attentional bias; color vision; controlled study; eye tracking; female; human; internet addiction; Internet gaming disorder; major clinical study; male; middle aged; response time; Stroop test; video game; addiction; analysis of variance; computer; Internet; mental disease; photostimulation; psychology; reaction time; recognition; Stroop test; video game; vision; young adult; Analysis of Variance; Attentional Bias; Behavior, Addictive; Computers; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Mental Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Stroop Test; Video Games; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966332528

The present cross-sectional study examined such relationships in formerly depressed and never depressed participants presumably at increased or decreased risk for depression, respectively. Participants completed a dot-probe task assessing attention toward sad, happy, and neutral facial expressions, as well as measures of reassurance-seeking, negative feedback-seeking, fear of negative evaluation, interpersonal competence, and rumination. Regression models examined associations between these factors and attention allocation. Between-group differences in attention allocation were not found, but regression model factors accounted for significant variance in attention in the full sample and in the formerly depressed subsample. In particular, attention to sad faces correlated with negative feedback-seeking, depressive symptoms, and interpersonal competence. Attention to happy faces correlated negatively with rumination. Although these data cannot speak to cause or directionality, they implicate theory-consistent connections between directing attention toward facial emotion and patterns of behavior and thought relevant to interpersonal functioning and feedback about the self. These findings may facilitate increased understanding of relations between interpersonal behaviors related to depression and patterns of attention allocation. © 2016 Guilford Publications, Inc.",,,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960087187

Less is known about whether selective attention towards emotionally positive stimuli relates to mental health and stress resilience. The current study used a modified Dot Probe task to investigate if individual differences in attentional biases towards either happy or angry emotional stimuli, or an interaction between these biases, are related to self-reported trait stress resilience. In a nonclinical sample (N = 43), we indexed attentional biases as individual differences in reaction time for stimuli preceded by either happy or angry (compared to neutral) face stimuli. Participants with greater attentional bias towards happy faces (but not angry faces) reported higher trait resilience. However, an attentional bias towards angry stimuli moderated this effect: The attentional bias towards happy faces was only predictive for resilience in those individuals who also endorsed an attentional bias towards angry stimuli. An attentional bias towards positive emotional stimuli may thus be a protective factor contributing to stress resilience, specifically in those individuals who also endorse an attentional bias towards negative emotional stimuli. Our findings therefore suggest a novel target for prevention and treatment interventions addressing stress-related psychopathology. © 2016 Thoern et al.

This study investigated the effects of seven-day quetiapine administration on sleep, circadian rhythms and emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers received 150 mg quetiapine XL for seven nights and 20 matched controls received placebo. Sleep-wake actigraphy was completed for one week both pre-dose and during drug treatment. On Day 8, participants completed emotional processing tasks. Results: Actigraphy revealed that quetiapine treatment increased sleep duration and efficiency, delayed final wake time and had a tendency to reduce within-day variability. There were no effects of quetiapine on subjective ratings of mood or energy. Quetiapine-treated participants showed diminished bias towards positive words and away from negative words during recognition memory. Quetiapine did not significantly affect facial expression recognition, emotional word categorisation, emotion-potentiated startle or emotional word/faces dot-probe vigilance reaction times. Conclusions: These changes in sleep timing and circadian rhythmicity in healthy volunteers may be relevant to quetiapine's therapeutic actions. Effects on emotional processing did not emulate the effects of antidepressants. The effects of quetiapine on sleep and circadian rhythms in patients with bipolar disorder merit further investigation to elucidate its mechanisms of action. © The Author(s) 2016.","bipolar disorder; circadian rhythm; emotion processing; Quetiapine; sleep","placebo; quetiapine; antidepressant agent; neuroleptic agent; quetiapine; actimetry; adult; analysis of variance; Article; circadian rhythm; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug activity; drug efficacy; emotionality; evening dosage; facial expression; female; human; human experiment; male; memory consolidation; Mini Mental State Examination; normal human; priority journal; psychometry; randomized controlled trial; recognition; sleep; sleep waking cycle; treatment duration; treatment response; adolescent; affect; bipolar disorder; circadian rhythm; drug effects; emotion; memory; reaction time; sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Circadian Rhythm; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Memory; Quetiapine Fumarate; Reaction Time; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958969637

Arousal was assessed using salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), a biomarker of noradrenergic arousal and attention bias using a dot-probe task. Twenty-nine women and 27 men completed the dot-probe task and provided saliva samples before and after a stress induction [cold pressor stress (CPS) test]. Women displayed a significant increase in arousal (sAA) following the stressor compared to men, who displayed a significant reduction in arousal. Reaction time data revealed a significant avoidance of threat in women at baseline, but a significant change to an attention bias towards threat following the stressor. Men did not significantly respond to the stressor in terms of attentional bias. These findings suggest that women are more reactive to a stressor than men, and display an initial avoidance response to threat, but an attentional bias towards threat following stress. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Arousal; Attention bias; Dot probe; Gender differences; Noradrenaline; Salivary alpha-amylase","alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; acute stress; adult; arousal; Article; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; cold pressor test; facial expression; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; response time; saliva analysis; sex difference; task performance; threat; attention; emotion; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; reaction time; sexual development; Arousal; Attention; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Salivary alpha-Amylases; Sex Characteristics; Stress, Physiological",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951569851

Mechanisms underlying the brain's adaptation to anxiolytic treatments are likely related both to structural plasticity and functional response alterations, but multimodal neuroimaging studies addressing structure-function interactions are currently missing. Here, we examined treatment-related changes in brain structure (gray matter (GM) volume) and function (blood-oxygen level dependent, BOLD response to self-referential criticism) in 26 participants with social anxiety disorder randomly assigned either to CBT or an attention bias modification control treatment. Also, 26 matched healthy controls were included. Significant time x treatment interactions were found in the amygdala with decreases both in GM volume (family-wise error (FWE) corrected PFWE=0.02) and BOLD responsivity (PFWE=0.01) after successful CBT. Before treatment, amygdala GM volume correlated positively with anticipatory speech anxiety (PFWE=0.04), and CBT-induced reduction of amygdala GM volume (pre-post) correlated positively with reduced anticipatory anxiety after treatment (PFWE≤0.05). In addition, we observed greater amygdala neural responsivity to self-referential criticism in socially anxious participants, as compared with controls (PFWE=0.029), before but not after CBT. Further analysis indicated that diminished amygdala GM volume mediated the relationship between decreased neural responsivity and reduced social anxiety after treatment (P=0.007). Thus, our results suggest that improvement-related structural plasticity impacts neural responsiveness within the amygdala, which could be essential for achieving anxiety reduction with CBT. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

In the present study, an engaging, gamified ABMT mobile application, or ""app,"" was utilized in 42 (21 females) trait-anxious adults. EEG was recorded during pre- and post-training threat bias assessment to generate scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting neurocognitive responses to threat. Following app play (ABMT versus placebo), subjective anxiety and stress responses (observed and self-reported) were measured. ABMT, versus placebo, resulted in improved behavioral performance during the stress task for females, and in potentiation of the N2 ERP to threat for males, suggesting increased attention control. Training groups did not differ in self-reported anxiety. ABMT also resulted in improved performance during the stress task among those evidencing specific pre-training ERP responses: decreased P1, suggesting less attention allocation, but potentiated N170, suggesting enhanced attention selection and discrimination. Differences in behavioral threat bias did not moderate training effects. Results suggest that efficient allocation of attention to threat combined with enhanced discrimination between threat and non-threat may facilitate stress-reduction effects of ABMT.

Unhealthy food intake was moderately reduced by food-specific inhibition training and attention bias modification post-intervention.

The basic cognitive mechanisms associated with attention biases in youth, however, remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that threat bias (selective attention for threatening versus neutral stimuli) but not sad bias relies on stimulus-driven attention. We collected measures of stimulus-driven attention, threat bias, sad bias, and current clinical symptoms in youth with a history of an anxiety disorder and/or depression (ANX/DEP; n = 40) as well as healthy controls (HC; n = 33). Stimulus-driven attention was measured with a non-emotional spatial orienting task, while threat bias and sad bias were measured at a short time interval (150 ms) with a spatial orienting task using emotional faces and at a longer time interval (500 ms) using a dot-probe task. In ANX/DEP but not HC, early attention bias towards threat was negatively correlated with later attention bias to threat, suggesting that early threat vigilance was associated with later threat avoidance. Across all subjects, stimulus-driven orienting was not correlated with early threat bias but was negatively correlated with later threat bias, indicating that rapid stimulus-driven orienting is linked to later threat avoidance. No parallel relationships were detected for sad bias. Current symptoms of depression but not anxiety were related to decreased stimulus-driven attention. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that threat bias but not sad bias relies on stimulus-driven attention. These results inform the design of attention bias modification programs that aim to reverse threat biases and reduce symptoms associated with pediatric anxiety and depression. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention bias; Depression; Sad bias; Stimulus-driven attention; Threat bias","adolescent; anxiety disorder; attention; child; depression; depth perception; emotion; facial expression; fear; female; human; male; pathophysiology; physiology; Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Child; Depression; Emotions; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Space Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955708922

However, it is unknown whether this attentional bias reflects facilitated attentional engagement with depressogenic information, or impaired attentional disengagement from such information. The present study was designed to address this question. In keeping with recent theoretical proposals, our findings demonstrate that heightened ruminative disposition is associated only with impaired attentional disengagement from depressogenic information, and does not involve facilitated attentional engagement with such information. In addition to resolving this key issue, the present study provided converging support for the previous claim that rumination-linked attentional bias is specific to depressogenic information, and also lends weight to the contention that rumination-linked attentional bias may be evident only when controlled attentional processing is readily permitted by using stimulus exposure durations of 1,000 ms.

This study investigated the role of AB in adolescents diagnosed with alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine or GHB dependency on entering therapy and six months later, and the role of executive control (EC) as a moderator of the relationship between problem severity and AB. Methods: Seventy-eight young substance-dependent (SD) patients (mean age = 19.5), and 64 healthy controls (HC; mean age = 19.0) were tested. Thirty-eight SD patients took part at 6-month follow-up (FU). AB was indexed by a visual probe task, EC by the attention network task, problem severity by the short alcohol (or drug) use disorder identification test and the severity of dependence questionnaire. Results: SD patients demonstrated an AB for substance stimuli presented for 500. ms and 1250. ms, with the latter related to severity of dependence. There was a nonsignificant tendency indicating that EC was higher in HC than SD participants, but EC did not moderate the relationship between AB and dependency. Substance use, dependency, EC and AB remained unchanged in the 6 month FU period. Conclusions: Young SD patients showed a stronger relatively early as well as maintained AB toward substance cues. A stronger maintained attention was related to higher severity of dependence. Further, there were some indications that EC might play a role in adolescent substance use. The finding that at FU AB and problem severity were not decreased, and EC was not increased underlines the persistent character of addiction. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Addiction; Adolescents; Attentional bias; Executive control; Substance use","adolescent; adult; alcoholism; Article; attention network task; attentional bias; behavior disorder assessment; cannabis addiction; child; cognition assessment; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; drug abuse; executive function; female; follow up; gamma hydroxybutyrate dependence; help seeking behavior; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; severity of dependence questionnaire; sex difference; substance abuse; substance use disorder identification ttest; visual probe task; adolescent behavior; association; attention; Behavior, Addictive; case control study; psychology; severity of illness index; Substance-Related Disorders; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cues; Executive Function; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult","60-60600-97-202","This study has been financially supported by a grant from the ZonMw Risk Behavior and Dependence grants ( 60-60600-97-202 ) and the Heymans Institute for Psychological Research .",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955144517

This study assessed bias in selective attention to facial emotions in negative symptoms of schizophrenia and its influence on subsequent memory for facial emotions.Methods. Thirty people with schizophrenia who had high and low levels of negative symptoms (n = 15, respectively) and 21 healthy controls completed a visual probe detection task investigating selective attention bias (happy, sad, and angry faces randomly presented for 50, 500, or 1000 ms). A yes/no incidental facial memory task was then completed. Attention bias scores and recognition errors were calculated.Results. Those with high negative symptoms exhibited reduced attention to emotional faces relative to neutral faces; those with low negative symptoms showed the opposite pattern when faces were presented for 500 ms regardless of the valence. Compared to healthy controls, those with high negative symptoms made more errors for happy faces in the memory task. Reduced attention to emotional faces in the probe detection task was significantly associated with less pleasure and motivation and more recognition errors for happy faces in schizophrenia group only.Conclusions.

In contrast, unpredictability of stressors is assumed to facilitate the development of sustained anxiety. Despite the frequent co-morbidity of depression and anxiety disorders, these two factors have rarely been studied simultaneously in humans. Therefore, we investigated whether there are interaction effects of uncontrollability and unpredictability on anxiety response in healthy participants. Seventy-nine healthy participants performed a visual dot probe task with emotional faces, while receiving mild electrical shocks in four different conditions (2 × 2 factorial design). In (un)controllable conditions, participants were (not) able to attenuate shock intensity. In (un)predictable conditions, participants were (not) able to anticipate shock occurrence. Before the experiment, participants subclinical depression and anxiety scores were measured using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI/BAI). During the experiment, continuous skin conductance and self-reported state anxiety were assessed and attentional biases towards angry faces were calculated. As expected, participants showed greater anxiety in uncontrollable compared to controllable and in unpredictable compared to predictable conditions. Additionally, anxiety decreased within the test sessions in participants with low BDI/BAI scores but not in participants with higher BDI/BAI scores. Most importantly, controllability and predictability interacted with each other and with BDI/BAI scores with regard to anxiety. Our results provide evidence that uncontrollability and unpredictability of stressors not only have separate but also interaction effects on several anxiety measures in susceptible individuals and may provide insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying a depressive/anxiety co-morbidity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","affective disorders; anxiety learning; Behavioral control; electrodermal activity; prediction; stress response","adult; anxiety; Article; attentional bias; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; depression; electric shock; female; human; human experiment; investigative procedures; major clinical study; male; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; priority journal; self report; shock; skin conductance; social interaction; stress; subclinical depression; uncontrollable stress; unpredictable stress; anxiety; depression; electrodermal response; electrostimulation; emotion; learned helplessness; mental stress; pathophysiology; psychological rating scale; psychology; task performance; uncertainty; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Electric Stimulation; Emotions; Female; Galvanic Skin Response; Helplessness, Learned; Humans; Male; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Stress, Psychological; Task Performance and Analysis; Uncertainty; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955748129

This study investigated the longevity of such modification effects. Using a dot probe paradigm, a community sample of overweight and obese women (N = 104) was trained to direct attention towards (‘attend’) or away from (‘avoid’) food pictures. Participants completed five weekly training sessions. Attentional bias was measured before and after training, at 24 h and one-week follow-up. To increase generalisability, at each of the post-training and follow-up assessments, participants were shown a mix of old and new food pictures. They also completed another implicit bias measure, i.e. a word stem task. Attentional bias for food increased in the ‘attend’ group and decreased in the ‘avoid’ group. These retraining effects were maintained at 24 h and one-week follow-up, and extended to new food pictures. Participants in the ‘avoid’ group also produced relatively fewer food words on the word stem task than those in the ‘attend’ group. Results are consistent with predictions of cognitive-motivational models that attentional biases are malleable. They further suggest that attentional bias modification, which targets the implicit processes that underlie the heightened food responsivity in overweight individuals, could help combat pathological (over)eating. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","attentional bias modification; dot probe task; food cues; longevity; overweight","adolescent; adult; aged; association; attention; female; food; human; middle aged; motivation; obesity; physiology; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attention; Cues; Female; Food; Humans; Middle Aged; Motivation; Obesity; Overweight; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947488374

Consistent with cognitive theories, the probe detection task has shown that social anxiety is associated with an attentional bias to avoid social information. This information processing bias is suggested to be involved in maintaining anxiety. Evidence is emerging for information processing biases being involved with stuttering. Aims This study investigated information processing in adults who stutter using the probe detection task. Information processing biases have been implicated in anxiety maintenance in social anxiety disorder and therefore may have implications for the assessment and treatment of stuttering. It was hypothesized that stuttering participants compared with control participants would display an attentional bias to avoid attending to social information. Methods & Procedures Twenty-three adults who stutter and 23 controls completed a probe detection task in which they were presented with pairs of photographs: a face displaying an emotional expression - positive, negative or neutral - and an everyday household object. All participants were subjected to a mild social threat induction being told they would speak to a small group of people on completion of the task. Outcomes & Results The stuttering group scored significantly higher than controls for trait anxiety, but did not differ from controls on measures of social anxiety. Non-socially anxious adults who stutter did not display an attentional bias to avoid looking at photographs of faces relative to everyday objects. Higher scores on trait anxiety were positively correlated with attention towards photographs of negative faces. Conclusion & Implications Attentional biases as assessed by the probe detection task may not be a characteristic of non-socially anxious adults who stutter. A vigilance to attend to threat information with high trait anxiety is consistent with findings of studies using the emotional Stroop task in stuttering and social anxiety disorder. Future research should investigate attentional processing in people who stutter who are socially anxious. It will also be useful for future studies to employ research paradigms that involve speaking. Continued research is warranted to explore information processing and potential biases that could be involved in the maintenance of anxiety and failure to maintain the benefits of speech treatment outcomes. © 2015 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.","attentional bias; social anxiety disorder; stuttering","adult; Anxiety Disorders; attention; cultural anthropology; facial expression; female; human; human relation; male; pattern recognition; perception; Phobic Disorders; psychology; speech; stuttering; young adult; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Culture; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Phobic Disorders; Social Perception; Speech; Stuttering; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954305235

One possible explanation for this inconsistency is that most such studies have failed to distinguish bias in attentional engagement with, and in attentional disengagement from, negative social information. It has been proposed that only one of these two possible forms of attentional bias may be associated with elevated social anxiety vulnerability, potentially giving rise to observed inconsistencies when assessment approaches have failed to dissociate them. The few studies that have sought to investigate this issue have been hampered by methodological limitations, which have compromised their capacity to differentially assess these two facets of attentional selectivity. In the present study, we employed a recently developed variant of the attentionalprobe task that has proven capable of dissociating attentional engagement bias and disengagement bias, to contrast the patterns of attentional selectivity shown by participants high and low in social anxiety. Our findings reveal that elevated social anxiety vulnerability is characterized only by facilitated attentional engagement with socially negative information and not by impaired attentional disengagement from socially negative information. © The Author(s) 2016.","Attentional bias; Attentional-probe task; Disengagement; Engagement; Social anxiety","anxiety; attentional bias; dissociation; human; human experiment; selective attention","DP140103713; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045","This work was supported by Australian Research Council Grants DP140104448 and DP140103713, and by a grant from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS?UEFISCDI, Project Number PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995493637

The dot-probe task has been widely used to study this phenomenon. Recent findings suggest that biased processing of positive information might also be an important aspect of developing psychopathological symptoms. However, despite some evidence suggesting persons with symptoms of depression and anxiety may avoid positive information, many dot-probe studies have produced null findings. The present review used conventional and novel metaanalytic methods to evaluate dot-probe attentional biases away from positive information and, for comparison, toward negative information, in depressed and anxious individuals. Results indicated that avoidance of positive information is a real effect exhibiting substantial evidential value among persons experiencing psychopathology, with individuals evidencing primary symptoms of depression clearly demonstrating this effect. Different theoretical explanations for these findings are evaluated, including those positing threat-processing structures, even-handedness, self-regulation, and reward devaluation, with the novel theory of reward devaluation emphasized and expanded. These novel findings and theory suggest that avoidance of prospective reward helps to explain the cause and sustainability of depressed states.

Previous studies have provided that the behavioral data of reaction time (RT) is the main evidence of the attentional bias (AB) to drug cues in the heroin dependence. It is the primary method of measuring AB among the addicts. In this paper, RT is used to test the AB of the heroin addict towards heroin-related cues by using the dot-probe task. Meanwhile, event-related potentials (ERPs) are used to compare the differences between heroin addicts and normal controls. The heroin-related dot-probe task is performed on the heroin addicts (n = 22) and health normal controls (n = 22). The results show that heroin addicts have more expeditious response when the dot located on the heroin-related picture (valid) compared with on the neutral picture (invalid). Meanwhile, it is opposite to controls. At onset of the images, the average amplitude of P1 and P2 show obvious differences between addicts and controls at FCz. When at onset of the dot, an increased N2 is elicited under the valid condition compared with the invalid condition, which appeared in heroin addicts and controls. The latency of P3 of the controls is longer than that of addicts at Pz.

Second, we followed women with remitted MDD prospectively to determine if the attentional biases retrospectively associated with MDD history would predict MDD recurrence across a 2-year follow-up. We found that women who spent a greater proportion of time looking at angry faces during the dot-probe task at the baseline assessment had a significantly shorter time to MDD onset.

The aims of this study were to compare the strength of cognitive biases between light and problematic drinkers, to explore the role of IQ on the cognitive biases and to study the psychometric qualities of the measures. Method: Participants (N=130) were divided into four groups based on IQ and severity of alcohol use-related problems: light (n=28) and problematic drinkers (n=25) with (sub)average IQ and light (n=33) and problematic drinkers (n=44) with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID). All participants performed the visual dot probe task and the approach avoidance task to measure the strength of cognitive biases. Results: In contrast with the hypothesis, no cognitive biases were found in problematic drinkers. Full scale IQ nor level of craving influenced the strength of the cognitive biases in light and problematic drinkers, although IQ did influence task performance (i.e. large intra-individual, trial-to-trial variation in reaction time). The internal consistency of the visual dot probe task was good, whereas the internal consistency of the approach avoidance task was poor. Conclusion: Cognitive biases seem to vary within the group of problematic drinkers as a whole. The psychometric qualities of the measures are problematic, especially in relation to the intra-individual variability in reaction time found in participants with MBID. Until the implications of this variability on the validity of implicit measures and establishing bias scores are more clear, the use of these measures in individuals with MBID calls for scrutiny. © 2016 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Addiction; Alcohol; Cognitive biases; Mild intellectual disability; Psychometric qualities","adult; alcoholism; approach avoidance task; Article; avoidance behavior; cognitive bias; cognitive function test; controlled study; executive function; female; human; intellectual impairment; male; pilot study; reaction time; task performance; visual dot probe task; withdrawal syndrome; alcoholism; attitude; comparative study; drinking behavior; intellectual impairment; psychology; severity of illness index; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Attitude; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Severity of Illness Index",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957961137

An experimental design of 2 (facial expression: positive and negative)×2 (consistency of probe point and facial expression: consistent and inconsistent)×2 (PTG level: high and low) was employed. Results: Patients with low PTG level had attention bias toward the negative emotional stimuli, and difficulty in distraction from the negative emotional pictures. The value of D and DI were both significantly greater than 0 (p<0.05). Patients with high PTG level did not demonstrate significant attention bias toward positive or negative emotional stimuli. The responding time of patients with high PTG level was significantly shorter than that in patients with low PTG level in the incongruent task (p<0.05).

In particular, temperamental negative affect places children at risk for the development of anxiety. However, not all children who show negative affect go on to develop anxiety or extreme social withdrawal. Recent research indicates that reactive control, in the form of attention to threat, may serve as a bridge between early temperament and the development of later social difficulties. In addition, variation in effortful control may also modulate this trajectory. Children (mean age = 5.57 years) were assessed for attention bias to threatening and pleasant faces using a dot-probe paradigm. Attention bias to threatening (but not happy) faces moderated the direct positive relation between negative affect and social withdrawal. Children with threat biases showed a significant link between negative affect and social withdrawal, whereas children who avoided threat did not. In contrast, effortful control did not moderate the relation between negative affect and social withdrawal. Rather, there was a direct negative relation between effortful control and social withdrawal. The findings from this short report indicate that the relations among temperament, attention bias, and social withdrawal appears early in life and point to early emerging specificity in reactive and regulatory functioning. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Attention bias; Dot-probe; Effortful control; Negative affect; Social withdrawal; Temperament","affect; anxiety; attention; child; emotion; female; human; male; physiology; preschool child; psychology; social behavior; temperament; Affect; Anxiety; Attention; Child; Child, Preschool; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Social Behavior; Temperament","MH073569; MH094633","Support for manuscript preparation was provided by grants from the National Institutes of Health to Koraly Pérez-Edgar ( MH073569 and MH094633 ).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945315754

Fewer studies, however, have investigated a similar effect of emotional stimuli on attentional orienting in the auditory domain together with an investigation of brain regions underlying such attentional modulation, which is the general aim of the present study. Therefore, we used an original auditory dot-probe paradigm involving simultaneously presented neutral and angry non-speech vocal utterances lateralized to either the left or the right auditory space, immediately followed by a short and lateralized single sine wave tone presented in the same (valid trial) or in the opposite space as the preceding angry voice (invalid trial). Behavioral results showed an expected facilitation effect for target detection during valid trials while functional data showed greater activation in the middle and posterior superior temporal sulci (STS) and in the medial frontal cortex for valid vs. invalid trials. The use of reaction time facilitation [absolute value of the Z-score of valid-(invalid+neutral)] as a group covariate extended enhanced activity in the amygdalae, auditory thalamus, and visual cortex. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of a large and distributed network of regions among which the STS, thalamus, and amygdala are crucial for the decoding of angry prosody, as well as for orienting and maintaining attention within an auditory space that was previously primed by a vocal emotional event. ï¿½ 2016 Ceravolo, Frï¿½hholz and Grandjean.","Anger; Attention; FMRI; Prosody; Spatial hearing; Voice","amygdala; anger; attention; brain region; facilitation; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hearing; medial frontal cortex; modulation; reaction time; stimulus; thalamus; visual cortex; voice",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973575871

Eysenck suggests that different personality types show different attentional biases to threatening information. This study is the first to test Eysenck's theory within a chronic back pain population by investigating the attentional biases of four different personality types using a back pain specific dot-probe paradigm. Participants were 70 volunteers (45 female) recruited from a back rehabilitation program at an NHS Trust. The four groups were selected on their trait anxiety and defensiveness scores: defensive high-anxious; high-anxious; repressor and non-extreme. Participants completed a dot probe task comprising 20 practice trials and 250 experimental trials. The experimental trials contained 100 threat-neutral pairs, 100 positive-neutral pairs and 50 neutral-neutral image pairings. The threat images were taken from the Photograph Series of Daily Activities (PHODA) and the neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) image bank. The results provided partial support for Eysenck's theory; defensive high-anxious individuals showed an attentional bias for threatening information compared to high-anxious individuals who demonstrated no bias. Repressors showed an avoidant bias to threatening images and an attentional bias to positive stimuli relative to neutral images. The clear difference in responses demonstrated by high-anxious individuals who vary in defensiveness highlight the need for separate investigation of these heterogeneous groups and help to explain the cognitive processes of defensive highanxious individuals within a pain population. The demonstration of an attentional bias in this group to threatening information could explain why defensive high-anxious individuals are more likely to re-present for treatment. © 2016 Franklin et al.

To understand consumers' reactions and to be able to innovate, one must understand how perception is held in a dynamic way and through the use of objective measures. Knowing that physiological and behavioral changes can reflect either emotional or attentional capture, the goal of this study was to evaluate whether car exterior designs could evoke significant reactions through the use of these dynamic and objective measures. Hence, different pictures of car exteriors were divided into two types: concept (C; non-commercialized cars, innovative designs), and non-concept (NC; commercialized cars), as studies have already shown that more innovative designs are cognitively more demanding (Carbon, Hutzler, & Minge, 2006). In a dot probe task, two cars were shown simultaneously for 500ms, followed by a dot, with participants having to push a button depending on which side the dot appeared on. Reaction time, electrodermal activity and eye movements were registered during the task. NC cars elicited higher mean electrodermal response and saccadic peak velocity than C cars. An exploratory analysis also revealed significant differences regarding different car shapes.","Attention; Car design; Electrodermal activity; Emotion; Eye movement","Automotive industry; Carbon; Design; Electrodes; Attention; Behavioral changes; Car designs; Electrodermal activity; Electrodermal response; Emotion; Exploratory analysis; Objective measure; Eye movements",,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995695062

We accomplished this by combining an item-method directed forgetting task with a testing procedure and modeling approach inspired by the delayed-estimation paradigm used in the study of visual short-term memory (STM). Abstract or concrete colored images were each followed by a remember (R) or forget (F) instruction and sometimes by a visual probe requiring a speeded detection response (E1-E3). Memory was tested using an old-new (E1-E2) or remember-know-no (E3) recognition task followed by a continuous color judgment task (E2-E3); a final experiment included only the color judgment task (E4). Replicating the existing literature, more ""old"" or ""remember"" responses were made to R than F items and RTs to postinstruction visual probes were longer following F than R instructions. Color judgments were more accurate for successfully recognized or recollected R than F items (E2-E3); a mixture model confirmed a decrease to both the probability of retrieving the F items as well as the fidelity of the representation of those F items that were retrieved (E4). We conclude that intentional forgetting is an effortful process that not only reduces the likelihood of successfully encoding an item for later retrieval, but also produces an impoverished memory trace even when those items are retrieved; these findings draw a parallel between the control of memory representations within working and long-term memory. © 2016 The Author(s).","Attention; Color memory; Intentional forgetting; Item-method directed forgetting; Working memory","attention; behavior; decision making; defense mechanism; female; human; long term memory; male; pattern recognition; probability; reaction time; recall; recognition; statistical model; young adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Intention; Judgment; Likelihood Functions; Male; Mental Recall; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Probability; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Repression, Psychology; Retention (Psychology); Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952815626

In the first 2 studies, we exposed participants to 3-dimensional high-fractal versus low-fractal stimuli, respectively characterized by a relatively high versus low degree of internal repetition of visual information. Participants evaluated high-fractal stimuli as more complex and fascinating than their low-fractal counterparts. We assessed ease of processing by asking participants to solve effortful puzzles during and after exposure to high-fractal versus low-fractal stimuli. Across both studies, we found that puzzles presented during and after seeing high-fractal stimuli were perceived as the easiest ones to solve and were solved more accurately and faster than puzzles associated with the low-fractal stimuli. In Study 3, we ran the Dot Probe Procedure to rule out that the findings from Study 1 and Study 2 reflected differences in attentional bias between the high-fractal and low-fractal stimuli, rather than perceptual fluency.

Research indicates an association between childhood adversity and altered emotion processing. Depression is characterized by mood-congruent cognitive biases, which play a crucial role in symptom persistence and recurrence. However, whether attentional biases in adult major depression are associated with experienced childhood neglect or abuse remains unclear. Methods: A sample of 45 patients suffering from major depression were recruited to examine correlations between maltreatment experienced during childhood and attentional biases to sad and happy facial expressions. Attention allocation was assessed using the dot-probe task and a history of childhood maltreatment was measured by means of the 25-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Results: Our results indicate an association between childhood maltreatment and sustained attention toward sad facial expressions. This relationship was not confounded by severity of symptoms, age, verbal intelligence or more recent stressful experiences. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the hypothesis that a mood-congruent bias in emotion processing observed in major depression is related to early traumatic experiences. © 2015 Günther et al.","Attention; Childhood maltreatment; Depression; Facial emotions; Perception","adult; Article; attentional bias; child abuse; child neglect; child psychiatry; child sexual abuse; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; disease association; disease severity; early life stress; emotional bias; emotional stress; facial expression; female; happiness; human; intelligence; major clinical study; major depression; male; medical history; sadness; task performance; attention; child abuse survivor; emotion; major depression; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Attention; Depressive Disorder, Major; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938949685

Moreover, we studied whether the training also affected participants' avoidance behavior and their physical arousal upon being confronted with a real threat object. Results In Experiment 1, students with fear of spiders were trained. We found that the attention manipulation was successful, but the training failed to affect behavior or arousal. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used on snake-fearful students. Again, attention was trained in the expected directions. Moreover, participants whose attention had been trained away from snakes showed lower physiological arousal upon being confronted with a real snake. Limitations The study involved healthy students with normal distribution of the fear of spider/snake. Future research with clinical sample could help with determining the generalizability of the current findings. Conclusions The effect of ABM on specific phobia is still in question.

This study examined the longevity of these attentional bias modification effects. Methods A modified dot probe paradigm was used to determine whether alterations in biased attentional processing of food cues, and subsequent effects on consumption, were maintained at 24-h and one-week follow-up. One hundred and forty-nine undergraduate women were trained to direct their attention toward ('attend') or away from ('avoid') food cues (i.e., pictures of chocolate). Within each group, half received a single training session, the other half completed 5 weekly training sessions. Results Attentional bias for chocolate cues increased in the 'attend' group, and decreased in the 'avoid' group immediately post training. Participants in the 'avoid' group also ate disproportionately less of a chocolate food product in a so-called taste test than did those in the 'attend' group. Importantly, the observed re-training effects were maintained 24 h later and also one week later, but only following multiple training sessions. Limitations There are a number of limitations that could be addressed in future research: (a) the inclusion of a no-training control group, (b) the inclusion of a suspicion probe to detect awareness of the purpose of the taste test, and (c) the use of different tasks to assess and re-train attentional bias.

Recently, attention bias modification (ABM) has been shown to reduce threat biases and decrease anxiety. However, it is unclear whether ABM modifies neural activity linked to anxiety and risk. The current study examined the relationship between ABM and the error-related negativity (ERN), a putative biomarker of risk for anxiety disorders, and the relationship between the ERN and ABM-based changes in attention to threat. Fifty-nine participants completed a single-session of ABM and a flanker task to elicit the ERN—in counterbalanced order (i.e., ABM-before vs. ABM-after the ERN was measured). Results indicated that the ERN was smaller (i.e., less negative) among individuals who completed ABM-before relative to those who completed ABM-after. Furthermore, greater attentional disengagement from negative stimuli during ABM was associated with a smaller ERN among ABM-before and ABM-after participants. The present study suggests a direct relationship between the malleability of negative attention bias and the ERN. Explanations are provided for how ABM may contribute to reductions in the ERN.

This suggests that reduction of such biases may be a plausible strategy in the treatment of depressive symptoms. The present clinical randomized controlled trial examined long-term effects of a computerized attention bias modification (ABM) procedure on individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. Methods In a double-blind study design, 77 individuals with ongoing mild to severe symptoms of depression were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) ABM training (n = 27); 2) placebo (n = 27); 3) assessment-only (n = 23). In both the ABM and placebo conditions, participants completed 8 sessions of 216-trials (1728 in total) during a 2-week period. Assessments were conducted at pre-training and post-training (0, 2, 4, 8-week, 3, 7-month follow-ups). Change in depressive symptoms and restoration of asymptomatic level were the primary outcome measures. Results In the ABM, but not the other two conditions, significant reductions in depressive symptoms were found at post-training and maintained during the 3-month follow-up. Importantly, more participants remained asymptomatic in the ABM condition, as compared to the other two conditions, from post-training to 7-month follow-up. ABM also significantly reduced secondary outcome measures including rumination and trait anxiety, and notably, the ABM effect on reducing depressive symptoms was mediated by rumination. Limitation Generalization of the findings may be limited because the present sample included only college students. Conclusions The ABM effect on reducing depressive symptoms was maintained for at least 3-month duration in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms, and these results suggest that ABM may be a useful tool for the prevention of depressive symptoms.

The current study investigated whether initial AB (towards or away from spider images) influenced the effectiveness of ABM in spider fear. Methods AB was assessed with an attentional probe task consisting of spider and neutral images presented simultaneously followed by a probe in spider congruent or spider incongruent locations. Response time (RT) differences between spider and neutral trials > 25 ms was considered 'Bias Toward' threat. RT difference < - 25 ms was considered 'Bias Away' from threat, and a difference between -25 ms and +25 ms was considered 'No Bias'. Participants were categorized into Initial Bias groups using pre-ABM AB scores calculated at the end of the study. 66 participants' (Bias Toward n = 27, Bias Away n = 18, No Bias n = 21) were randomly assigned to ABM-active training designed to reduce or eliminate a bias toward threat and 61 (Bias Toward n = 17, Bias Away n = 18, No Bias n = 26) to ABM-control. Results ABM-active had the largest impact on those demonstrating an initial Bias Towards spider images in terms of changing AB and reducing Spider Fear Vulnerability, with the Bias Away group experiencing least benefit from ABM. However, all Initial Bias groups benefited equally from active ABM in a Stress Task. Limitations Participants were high spider fearful but not formally diagnosed with a specific phobia. Therefore, results should be confirmed within a clinical population. Conclusions Individual differences in Initial Bias may be an important determinant of ABM efficacy. © 2015 The Authors.","Attentional bias; Attentional training; Cognitive bias modification; Spider fear; Spider phobia; Threat detection","adult; anxiety assessment; Article; attentional bias; attentional bias modification; controlled study; depression assessment; diastolic blood pressure; fear; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; normal human; phobia; response time; spider; stress assesment; systolic blood pressure; threat; adolescent; adverse effects; animal; attention; blood pressure; cognitive therapy; individuality; middle aged; Phobic Disorders; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; regression analysis; spider; statistical bias; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Blood Pressure; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Phobic Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Regression Analysis; Spiders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939561808

Methods In experiment 1, participants received training either toward or away from negative images or no-training, and transfer to an affective task-switching task was examined. In two other experiments, participants were trained to orient attention toward either positive or negative words (experiment 2a) or facial expressions (experiment 2b), and transfer to an interpretation bias task was examined. Results In all experiments, the dot-probe training procedure did not effectively modify biases in attention allocation at the training condition level, but produced a large variability in individual attention bias acquisition within and across conditions. Individual differences in pre-training attention bias and attention bias acquisition were not related to performance on the affective task-switching task or the interpretation tasks. Limitations The present investigations are limited by the lack of effectiveness of ABM at the condition level, the order in which transfer tasks were administered, and the restricted range of affective symptoms that could moderate training and transfer effects. Conclusions The findings from three experiments provided no evidence for single-session dot-probe ABM procedures to effectively manipulate attention bias toward negative, away from negative, or toward positive stimuli at a training condition level. At the individual differences level of analysis, again no evidence was found for transfer of attention training. The observations invite further empirical scrutiny into factors that moderate attentional plasticity in response to dot-probe ABM procedures to optimize the conditions for effective implementation and transfer of training. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Affective task-switching; Attention training; Dot-probe; Interpretation; Transfer","Article; attentional bias; Beck Depression Inventory; behavior modification; dot probe training; emotional bias; emotional disorder; facial expression; human; interpretation bias; self report; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; training; undergraduate student; adolescent; adult; affect; anxiety; attention; decision making; depression; eye fixation; female; learning; male; photostimulation; physiology; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; reaction time; statistical bias; teaching; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Anxiety; Association Learning; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Depression; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Judgment; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reaction Time; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching; Transfer (Psychology); Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939487022

However, recent meta-analyses indicated mixed effects. Recent works suggest that the presence of AB prior to ABM can be considered as a critical moderating factor that may account for these mixed results. Methods We assessed AB among highly trait-anxious individuals (n = 77) using both a face-version and a word-version of the dot-probe task at multiple time points: two weeks before ABM (t1), just prior to ABM (t2), and after ABM (t3). All participants were submitted to an ABM procedure including facial expressions. Analyses focused on 2 components of AB prior to ABM: a stable component, representing variance shared between the two baseline points (t1 and t2), and a dynamic component, representing variance that is specific to that point (t1 or t2). Results The stable component of AB at baseline predicted the intensity of AB after ABM (t3) while the dynamic component did not. The dynamic component of AB at baseline positively predicts performance improvement during ABM procedure, while the stable component negatively predicted it. Limitations The findings depicted above only appear with the face-version of the dot-probe task. Conclusions The present results highlight the contribution of both the stable individual differences and dynamic components of preexistent AB. They also show the importance of moving the conceptualization of AB beyond the group-based analysis by integrating the notion and the assessment of within-person variability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Attention bias modification; Attentional bias for threat; Cognitive bias modification; Static-score; Within-person variability","adult; Article; assessment of humans; attention bias modification; attentional bias; Beck Depression Inventory; controlled study; Depression and anxiety score; facial expression; female; human; major clinical study; male; questionnaire; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; task performance; threat; adolescent; anxiety; association; attention; cognitive therapy; individuality; linguistics; middle aged; physiology; procedures; psychology; statistical bias; therapy; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Association; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Cognitive Therapy; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Vocabulary; Young Adult","UO, University of Oregon; FNRS, Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS","This research was supported by a Post-doctoral Grant ( FC 78142 ) from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research “F.R.S.-FNRS” (awarded to Alexandre Heeren).

Traumatic events can disrupt healthy threat monitoring, inducing biased and unstable threat-related attention deployment. Recent research suggests that greater attention bias variability, that is, attention fluctuations alternating toward and away from threat, occurs in participants with PTSD relative to healthy comparison subjects who were either exposed or not exposed to traumatic events. The current study extends findings on attention bias variability in PTSD. Method: Previous measurement of attention bias variability was refined by employing a moving average technique. Analyses were conducted across seven independent data sets; in each, data on attention bias variability were collected by using variants of the dot-probe task. Trauma-related and anxiety symptoms were evaluated across samples by using structured psychiatric interviews and widely used self-report questionnaires, as specified for each sample. Results: Analyses revealed consistent evidence of greater attention bias variability in patients with PTSD following various types of traumatic events than in healthy participants, participants with social anxiety disorder, and participants with acute stress disorder. Moreover, threat-related, and not positive, attention bias variability was correlated with PTSD severity.

These problems might be underpinned by negatively biased processing of social stimuli. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a novel Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) training to target information processing biases in patients with AN. Methods Twenty-eight patients with AN completed a baseline and end of intervention assessment of mood and social appraisals. The CBM training consisted of 5 sessions and included an attentional probe task to train attention towards positive social stimuli and an ambiguous scenarios task to train benign or neutral interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios. Results At baseline patients displayed an attention and interpretation bias towards negative social stimuli. At the end of intervention there was a medium sized increase in attention to positive faces and fewer negative interpretations of ambiguous social stimuli. There were also lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of self-compassion in response to a judgemental video clip. Limitations The lack of a control group is the main limitation to this preliminary study as the changes obtained may have resulted from non-specific aspects of the inpatient treatment. Conclusions A novel CBM training is associated with more positive processing of social information in AN.

Here we conduct the first systematic review of the sleep-related attentional bias construct, indexed through reaction time-based experimental tasks.

Included studies involved between-group comparisons (poor sleepers versus controls), as well as sleep manipulations and correlational investigations with healthy sleepers. For studies involving comparisons between poor sleepers and healthy controls, effect size estimates were computed for task-relevant dependent variables. Six of the nine studies comparing poor sleepers and controls revealed statistically significant group differences in support of a differential sleep-related attentional bias (medium-to-large effect sizes), with flicker, dot-probe and Posner tasks being most sensitive to group effects. Due to the paucity of studies and variability in design and measurement, no conclusions could be reached regarding manipulation or induction of attentional bias in good sleepers.

Methods In the present investigation, 96 adults with a range of anxiety disorders completed a dot probe task to assess threat-related attention biases before and after 12 sessions of CBT. Results Pretreatment deficits in disengaging attention from external and internal threats, and not the speed of engagement with threat, predicted reductions in clinical severity of diagnoses that were maintained 2 years later.

This prejudice can bias face perception at the very beginning of social interaction. However, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the influence of racial prejudice on facial emotion perception. Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust perception in racial prejudice using a passive viewing task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that compared with the disgusted faces of in-groups, the disgusted faces of out-groups result in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of the insula with amygdala-based emotional system, and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-based regulatory system. Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms revealed that the level of implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of the insula with both the amygdala and the ACC, which suggests that the insula is largely involved in racially biased disgust perception through two distinct neural circuits. In addition, individual difference in disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive of implicit racial prejudice. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role of insula-centered circuits for disgust perception in racial prejudice.

In the present study, we assessed the relative contribution of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pain-related genes, such as cathechol-O-methyl transferase gene (COMT), fatty acid amino hydrolase gene (FAAH), transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 gene (TRPV1), and δ-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1), for postsurgical pain chronification. Ninety preoperatively pain-free male patients were assigned to good or poor outcome groups according to their intensity or disability score assessed at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after funnel chest correction. The genetic effects were compared with those of two psychological predictors, the attentional bias toward positive words (dot-probe task) and the self-reported pain vigilance (Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire [PVAQ]), which were already shown to be the best predictors for pain intensity and disability at 6 months after surgery in the same sample, respectively. Cox regression analyses revealed no significant effects of any of the genetic predictors up to the end point of survival time at 1 year after surgery. Adding the genetics to the prediction by the attentional bias to positive words for pain intensity and the PVAQ for pain disability, again no significant additional explanation could be gained by the genetic predictors. In contrast, the preoperative PVAQ score was also, in the present enlarged sample, a meaningful predictor for lasting pain disability after surgery. Effect size measures suggested some genetic variables, for example, the polymorphism rs1800587G>A in the interleukin 1 alpha gene (IL1A) and the COMT haplotype rs4646312T>C/rs165722T>C/rs6269A>G/rs4633T>C/rs4818C>G/rs4680A>G, as possible relevant modulators of long-term postsurgical pain outcome. A comparison between pathophysiologically different predictor groups appears to be helpful in identifying clinically relevant predictors of chronic pain. © 2015 Dimova et al.","COMT; Genetics; OPRM1; Postoperative pain; PVAQ","buprenorphine; catechol methyltransferase; delta opiate receptor; diclofenac; dipyrone; fatty acid amidase; interleukin 1alpha; ketoprofen; paracetamol; piritramide; ropivacaine; sufentanil; vanilloid receptor 1; adolescent; adult; Article; attentional bias; BDKRB1 gene; CARD15 gene; COMT gene; disability; effect size; esthetic surgery; FAAH gene; funnel chest; GCH1 gene; gene; genetic association; haplotype; human; IL1A gene; IL1B gene; IL1RN gene; IL23R gene; major clinical study; male; MMP2 gene; NK1R gene; NR3C2 gene; OPRD1 gene; OPRM1 gene; pain assessment; pain intensity; Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire; patient controlled analgesia; postoperative pain; prediction; preoperative evaluation; psychologic test; psychological aspect; self report; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival time; TGFB1 gene; thorax surgery; treatment outcome; TRPA1 gene; TRPV1 gene",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949570708

However, such knowledge is relevant because anger bias may be a cognitive pathway mediating aggression in individuals susceptible to externalizing behavior. This paper therefore aims to clarify whether anger-prone and aggressive populations are emotionally biased toward perceiving others as angry and hostile when processing facial expressions in neuropsychological paradigms. A systematic search of electronic databases and a subsequent manual search identified 15 studies involving 21 experiments (n = 2155). Some type of biased perception pattern was observed in all but one study consisting of one experiment and two studies each consisting of two experiments in which one showed no bias. The biased perception pattern was, however, not restricted to a deficit in selective attention. Rather, it involved a broader bias pattern where anger and hostility were perceived from ambiguous and even unambiguous non-hostile expressions. The present review provides preliminary evidence that anger-prone and aggressive populations are characterized by bias toward perceiving others as angry and hostile when processing facial expressions in a variety of neuropsychological paradigms. Seeing enemies could, indeed, be a cognitive pathway that mediates reactive and instrumental aggression during social interaction among susceptible populations. However, more research is warranted in this unsystematically and poorly investigated area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggression; Anger; Anger bias; Attentional bias modification; Facial expressions; Recognition impairment","aggression; anger; cognition; emotion; facial expression; hostility; human; perception; priority journal; Review; selective attention; social interaction; systematic review",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950242259

This study was designed to address two unresolved issues regarding alcohol-related attention biases. Specifically, this study tested whether acute changes in positive and negative mood increase attentional biases toward alcohol cues and whether coping and enhancement drinking motives moderate these effects. Methods: Participants were 100 college students aged 18-25, who drank alcohol at least once in the last 90. days. In a 2. ×. 3 mixed design, participants were randomized to one of three mood conditions (neutral, negative, or positive) and completed visual-probe tasks pre- and post-mood-induction. Results: Attentional biases toward alcohol cues were significantly associated with alcohol consumption among men, but not women. Although the mood manipulation was highly successful, attentional biases did not vary as a function of mood condition and hypothesized moderating effects of drinking motives were not significant. Conclusions: The largely null findings of the experiment are discussed in light of the fact that the visual probe task had poor reliability. Issues related to the reliability of visual-probe task are discussed, as more research is needed to evaluate and improve the psychometrics of this method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Affect; Alcohol-related attentional bias; Drinking motives; Gender differences; Reliability; Visual-probe task","adult; alcohol consumption; Article; attentional bias; college student; controlled study; coping behavior; drinking behavior; female; human; male; mood; reliability; sex difference; task performance; adolescent; affect; association; attention; motivation; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sex ratio; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Alcohol Drinking; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Distribution; Young Adult","R01AA020519, NIH, National Institutes of Health",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84935898571

We investigated sex differences across these domains in a large community sample of children aged 10 to 14 years (n = 122) comprising 62 children with verified maltreatment experience and 60 well-matched nonmaltreated peers. The maltreated group relative to the nonmaltreated comparison group exhibited poorer social and emotional functioning (more peer problems and heightened emotional reactivity). Cognitively, they displayed a pattern of attentional avoidance of threat in a visual dot-probe task. Similar patterns were observed in males and females in these domains. Reduced gray matter volume was found to characterize the maltreated group in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal lobes, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus; sex differences were observed only in the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, a disordinal interaction between maltreatment exposure and sex was found in the postcentral gyrus. Finally, attentional avoidance to threat mediated the relationship between maltreatment and emotional reactivity, and medial orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume mediated the relationship between maltreatment and peer functioning. Similar mediation patterns were observed across sexes.

Ninety children, 45 cognitively able with ASD and 45 age, perceptual-IQ, and gender matched typically developing children, aged 7–12 years, were administered a visual dot probe task using threatening facial pictures. Parent-reported anxiety symptoms were also collected. Children with ASD showed similarly high levels of anxiety compared with normative data from an anxiety disordered sample. Children with ASD had higher levels of parent-reported anxiety but did not show differences in disengaging from, or facilitated attention toward, threatening facial stimuli compared with typically developing children. In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not. There were no correlations between attentional biases and anxiety symptoms and no gender differences.

This study examined whether FNE also moderates responses to exclusion in early-stage interpersonal perception, manifested in selective attention. The experiment using a dot-probe task revealed that exclusion led participants with low levels of FNE to increase attention to signs of social acceptance (i.e., smiling faces). It also revealed that exclusion led those with high levels of FNE to pay more attention to signs of social threat (i.e., angry faces) relative to those of social acceptance. Thus, exclusion makes the motivation to protect oneself from social threats dominant over the motivation to reestablish social bonds among those who fear negative evaluation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Fear of negative evaluation; Selective attention; Social exclusion","adolescent; Article; attention; attentional bias; controlled study; depression; facial expression; fear; fear of negative evaluation; female; human; human experiment; human relation; male; motivation; perception; priority journal; selective attention; social acceptance; social aspect; social bonding; social exclusion; social phobia; attention; attitude; controlled clinical trial; Depressive Disorder; emotion; human relation; perception; psychology; questionnaire; social adaptation; social behavior; social desirability; video game; young adult; Attention; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Rejection (Psychology); Social Adjustment; Social Behavior; Social Desirability; Social Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938967591

As a theoretical construct, craving is complex and described by different authors, which results in various theoretical models, but there is a consensus on the importance of its treatment. This paper conducted a literature review to identify and describe the most widely used techniques of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for the management of craving and to verify the impact of applying these techniques on outcome variables, specifically the craving. Method: Searches were conducted in the databases of PubMed and PsycInfo using the following descriptors in association: “craving”, “cognitive therapy” “behavior therapy” and “cognitive behavior therapy”. Results: 198 papers were found, out of which thirty four were selected for analysis. The cognitive behavior therapy treatment includes various techniques such as Relapse Prevention, Psychoeducational, Humor and Stress Management, Motivational Interviewing, Exposure to the Relapse Prevention and Relaxation techniques. The manual for Project MATCH is one of the most cited and used for the treatment of drug addicts. Cue Exposure Therapy (CET), Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) and newer “mindfulness” therapeutic methods are studied, and have shown promising results, but still need to be further investigated.

Many previous studies have established that patients with MDD tend to pay selective attention to negative stimuli. The assessment of the level of cognitive bias is regarded as a crucial dimension of treatment outcomes for MDD. To our knowledge, no prior studies have been reported on the effects of treatment with escitalopram on attentional bias in MDD, employing a dot probe task of facial expression. We studied 25 patients with MDD and 25 controls, and used a dot probe task of facial expression to measure cognitive bias. The patients' psychopathologies were rated using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram. All participants performed the facial expression dot probe task. The results revealed that the 8 week escitalopram treatment decreased the HAMD scores. The patients with MDD at baseline exhibited an attentional bias towards negative faces, however, no significant bias toward either negative or happy faces were observed in the controls. After the 8 week escitalopram treatment, no significant bias toward negative faces was observed in the patient group. In conclusion, patients with MDD pay more attention to negative facial expressions, and treatment with escitalopram improves this attentional bias toward negative facial expressions. This is the first study, to our knowledge, on the effects of treatment with escitalopram on attentional bias in patients with MDD that has employed a dot probe task of facial expression. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attentional bias; Dot probe task; Escitalopram; Major depressive disorder","escitalopram; antidepressant agent; citalopram; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adult; Article; attentional bias; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; drug efficacy; facial expression; female; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; happiness; human; major depression; male; mental task; middle aged; observational study; outcome assessment; priority journal; sadness; selective attention; task performance; attention; Depressive Disorder, Major; drug effects; emotion; observer variation; psychology; severity of illness index; Adult; Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Citalopram; Depressive Disorder, Major; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Severity of Illness Index","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","This study was supported by the Nature Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province , China.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941173185

This study tested the hypothesis that this attentional focus toward mother occurs at the expense of attentional exploration of the environment. Ninety children, aged 8-12, completed questionnaires assessing trust in maternal support, watched a video that induced mild fear of dogs, and completed a dot probe computer task assessing attentional processing of simultaneously presented pictures of mother and pictures of the threatening stimulus (i.e., dogs).

In fact, there is an emerging field focusing on modifying attentional bias as a stand-alone treatment. However, it is unclear to what degree these attentional biases are present before commencing treatment. The purpose of this study was to measure pre-treatment attentional bias in 153 participants diagnosed with SAD using a home-based Internet version of the dot-probe paradigm. Results showed no significant correlation for attentional bias (towards or away from negative words or faces) and the self-rated version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR). However, two positive correlations were found for the secondary measures Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). These indicated that those with elevated levels of anxiety and depression had a higher bias towards negative faces in neutral-negative and positive-negative valence combinations, respectively. The unreliability of the dot-probe paradigm and home-based Internet delivery are discussed to explain the lack of correlations between LSAS-SR and attentional bias. Changes to the dot-probe task are suggested that could improve reliability. © 2015.","Attentional bias; Attentional bias modification; Dot-probe; Internet; Social anxiety disorder; Social phobia","adult; Article; assessment of humans; attentional bias; cognitive bias; correlation analysis; depression; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7; human; Internet; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; major clinical study; male; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; quality of life index; reliability; response time; self report; social phobia; Social Phobia Inventory; task performance","2011-38394-87877-7, VR, Vetenskapsrådet","The current study was made possible in part by a grant from the Swedish Research Council ( 2011-38394-87877-7 ) to the last author.

We thus aimed to (a) test a novel conceptualization and related operationalization of AB expression in time and (b) illuminate the nature of AB and specifically its temporal expression. We examined AB expression in time by means of a novel trial-level bias score (TL-BS) analysis of dot probe task data in two experiments—among spider phobics and healthy controls, and among smoking-deprived daily smokers. Findings revealed evidence of the dynamic expression of AB in time; furthermore, TL-BS parameters demonstrated unique associations with psychopathology and addiction beyond traditional bias score. The present research may help to bring the conceptualization and quantification of AB closer to the nature of the phenomenon and thereby advance basic and clinical knowledge. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","addiction; anxiety; attention paradigms; attentional bias; dot probe; emotional attention; information processing; motivation; phobia; reward; smoking; substance use; threat",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931290964

However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience. Methods Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n = 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces. Results Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. Limitations Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions. Conclusions Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience.

Thus, humans possess relationship maintenance mechanisms to protect against threats from those who serve as attractive alternatives or intrasexual rivals. Many studies have indicated that romantic love can act as a commitment device to activate these mechanisms. To examine the attentional bias associated with relationship maintenance among 108 college students (49 single and 59 committed females) in China, we used a semantic priming procedure to activate mental representations associated with romantic love and then asked participants to complete a dot-probe task for the purpose of making a distinction between the engage and disengage components of attention. No significant engaging effects toward attractive faces were observed among committed females, but the following significant disengaging effects were found: when primed with romantic love, single females showed increased attention toward and difficulty in disengaging from attractive male faces, whereas females already in a committed relationship did not alter their attention, remaining as inattentive to attractive alternatives as they were in the baseline condition. In addition, committed females responded to love priming by exhibiting difficulty in disengaging from attractive rivals. The present findings provide evidence in the Chinese cultural context for the existence of early-stage attentional processes in the domain of relationship maintenance that committed Chinese females protected an ongoing relationship by not only being inattentive to attractive males who could serve as attractive alternatives, but also being more attentive to attractive females who could be potential rivals when mental representations associated with romantic love were primed. © 2015 Ma et al.",,"adult; Article; attention; attentional bias; Chinese; cognition; college student; emotional attachment; female; human; human experiment; human relation; male; normal human; physical attractiveness; sexual behavior; social environment; social interaction; visual stimulation; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; attention; China; facial recognition; love; prejudice; psychology; student; university; young adult; Adolescent; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Attention; China; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Love; Prejudice; Students; Universities; Women; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943264070

The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to.44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures.

Up until now, this has focused almost exclusively on the goal of an action, neglecting the role of the effector. We addressed this by measuring changes in visual processing across time during motor preparation at both goal and effector locations. We compared event related potentials (ERPs) elicited by task-irrelevant visual probe stimuli at both goal and effector locations during motor preparation. Participants were instructed to place their hands on two starting positions (effector locations) and an auditory tone instructed them to immediately move to one of two target buttons (goal locations). Probe stimuli were presented in the interval between the offset of the cue and the execution of the movement at either a goal or an effector location. Probes were presented randomly at either 100. ms, 200. ms or 300. ms after the auditory cue.Analysis of the visual N1 ERP showed enhanced visual processing at moving vs. not-moving goal locations across all three SOAs. At effector locations, enhanced processing for the moving vs. not-moving effector was only observed during the middle (200. ms) SOA.These results demonstrate, for the first time, simultaneous perceptual enhancement of goal and effector locations during motor preparation. We interpret these results as reflecting a temporally and spatially specific dynamic attentional map of the environment that adapts to maximise efficiency of movement by selectively weighting processing of multiple functional components of action in parallel. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Action; Effector; Goal; Perception; Planning; Preparation","adult; Article; cognition; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; male; motivation; motor control; motor performance; motor preparation; movement (physiology); normal human; priority journal; sensorimotor function; vision; visual stimulation; brain cortex; electroencephalography; evoked response; motivation; motor activity; physiology; psychomotor performance; vision; young adult; Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Goals; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936746551

The current study experimentally tested this idea by randomly assigning adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to 4 weeks of computer-based attention bias modification designed to reduce negative attention bias or 4 weeks of placebo attention training. Findings indicate that compared to placebo training, attention bias modification reduced negative attention bias and increased resting-state connectivity within a neural circuit (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) that supports control over emotional information. Further, pre- to post-training change in negative attention bias was significantly correlated with depression symptom change only in the active training condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that pre- to post-training changes in resting state connectivity within a circuit associated with sustained attention to visual information (i.e., precuenus and middle frontal gyrus) contributed to symptom improvement in the placebo condition. Importantly, depression symptoms did not change differentially between the training groups-overall, a 40% decrease in symptoms was observed across attention training conditions. Findings suggest that negative attention bias is associated with the maintenance of depression; however, deficits in general attentional control may also maintain depression symptoms, as evidenced by resting state connectivity and depression symptom improvement in the placebo training condition. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Attention training; Cognitive bias manipulation; Depression; Resting-state fMRI","adult; Article; attentional bias; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; emotionality; exploratory research; female; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental task; middle frontal gyrus; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; resting state network; self control; symptom; therapy effect; visual information; adolescent; attention; brain; brain mapping; Depressive Disorder, Major; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological rating scale; psychology; symptom assessment; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Symptom Assessment; Young Adult","R01DA032457, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R21MH092430, NIH, National Institutes of Health",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938976992

In this meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy of ABM for SAD on symptoms, reactivity to speech challenge, attentional bias (AB) toward threat, and secondary symptoms at posttraining as well as SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up. A systematic search in bibliographical databases uncovered 15 randomized studies involving 1043 individuals that compared ABM to a control training procedure. Data were extracted independently by two raters. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted on intent-to-treat data. ABM produced a small but significant reduction in SAD symptoms (g = 0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g = 0.46), and AB (g = 0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the ABM procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g = 0.09) and SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g = 0.09) were not significant. Although there was no indication of significant publication bias, the quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes. From a clinical point of view, these findings imply that ABM is not yet ready for wide-scale dissemination as a treatment for SAD in routine care.

Considering visual attentional biases are a key factor implicated in a majority of fear-related phobias/anxieties, the purpose of this research was to investigate attentional biases to familiar and unfamiliar fruit and vegetables in 8 to 11 year old children with differing levels of food neophobia. To this end, 70 primary aged children completed a visual-probe task measuring attentional biases towards familiar and unfamiliar fruit/vegetables, as well as the food neophobia, general neophobia and willingness to try self-report measures. Results revealed that as an undifferentiated population all children appeared to demonstrate an attentional bias towards the unfamiliar fruit and vegetable stimuli. However, when considering food neophobia, this bias was significantly exaggerated for children self-reporting high food neophobia and negligible for children self-reporting low food neophobia. In addition, willingness to try the food stimuli was inversely correlated with attentional bias towards the unfamiliar fruits/vegetables.

Participants included 22 anxious and 20 control children (aged 7–12 years; 50 % female). Attention control was measured using a partial report-by-color task based on the theory of visual attention, which assesses ability to focus on task-relevant information and resist distraction by non-emotional task-irrelevant information. Attentional bias for emotional faces was assessed using a visual probe task with angry, happy, and neutral faces. Anxious and control children were assessed at baseline (pre-treatment) and, in addition, anxious children were re-assessed post-treatment and at 6 months following treatment. Before treatment, children with clinical anxiety showed poorer attention control and greater attentional bias for emotional faces in comparison to control children. Following treatment, anxious children showed a significant reduction in attentional bias for emotional faces, and a trend for improvement in attention control. There was no significant change in attentional bias or attention control between post-treatment and 6-months follow-up assessments. Findings contribute to prior research by showing that clinically anxious children exhibit both increased attention to emotional information and impaired attention control, and that following treatment their attentional bias and attention control are comparable with those of control children.

We assessed the effects of attentional bias modification (ABM), and the relationship between AB and treatment adherence in opiate dependent patients. Method: An independent groups design was used to compare 23 opiate dependent patients with 21 healthy controls. Participants completed an AB task before either a control or an ABM task designed to train attention away from substance-related stimuli. Pre- and post-ABM AB and craving were assessed to determine any changes. Relationships between treatment adherence ('using on top' of prescribed opiates or not) and AB, craving and psychopathology were also examined. Results: There was no baseline difference in AB between patients and controls, and no significant effect of ABM on AB or substance craving. However, treatment adherent patients who did not use illicit opiates on top of their prescribed opiates had statistically significantly greater AB away from substance-related stimuli than both participants using on top and controls, and reported significantly lower levels of craving than non-treatment adherent patients. Conclusion: Whilst we did not find any significant effects of ABM on AB or craving, patients who were treatment adherent differed from both those who were not and from controls in their attentional functioning and substance craving. These findings are the first to suggest that AB may be a within-treatment factor predictive of adherence to pharmacological treatment and potentially of recovery in opiate users. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attentional bias; Dependence; Illicit; Opiates; Prescribed","buprenorphine; buprenorphine; drug therapy; drug therapy; drug therapy; drug therapy; drug therapy; drug therapy; methadone; methadone; narcotic agent; adult; analysis of variance; Article; assessment of humans; attention; attentional bias; attentional bias modification; Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11; behavior change; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; controlled study; drug dependence; female; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7; human; human; impulsiveness; male; male; medication compliance; middle aged; nervous system parameters; opiate addiction; opiate substitution treatment; opiate substitution treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; patient attitude; patient compliance; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prescription; procedures; psychology; psychotherapy; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; rehabilitation; substance use; visual analog scale; withdrawal syndrome; withdrawal syndrome; Analysis of Variance; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Attention; Buprenorphine; Buprenorphine; Craving; Craving; Female; Female; Humans; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Male; Medication Adherence; Medication Adherence; Methadone; Methadone; methods; methods; methods; methods; Middle Aged; Middle Aged; Narcotics; Narcotics; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Opioid-Related Disorders; psychology; psychology; psychology; psychology; Psychotherapy; Psychotherapy; rehabilitation; rehabilitation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Surveys and Questionnaires; therapeutic use; therapeutic use; therapeutic use; therapeutic use; therapeutic use; therapeutic use","UCL, University College London; UCL, University College London","This study was supported by internal UCL funds.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964267060

Specifically,we investigated the relationship between pain catastrophizing and attention bias to pain facial expressions. Furthermore, drawing on dual process models in the context of pain, we investigated the moderating role of attention control on this relationship. Adolescents (N 5 73; age, 16-18 years) performed a dot-probe task in which facial expressions of pain and neutral expressions were presented for 100 milliseconds and 1250 milliseconds. Participants also completed self-report pain catastrophizing and attention control measures. We found that although there was no main effect of pain catastrophizing on attention bias towards pain faces, attention control did significantly moderate this relationship. Further analysis revealed that lower levels of attention control were significantly associatedwith increasing attentional vigilance towards pain faces only within high catastrophizing adolescents. In addition, we found that poorer attention control was related to increased attention bias for pain faces (regardless of pain catastrophizing level) when these faces were presented for relatively longer durations (ie, 1250milliseconds) but not for short durations (ie, 100 milliseconds). This study supports a dual processmodel of attentional processes in pain, thus replicating previous findings within the psychopathology literature but extending them to the study of pain.

Method: Data were obtained as part of the IMAGEN study, conducted across 8 European sites, with a community sample of 2257 adolescents. At 14 years, participants completed an emotional variant of the dot-probe task, as well two personality measures, namely the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale and the revised NEO Personality Inventory. At 14 and 16 years, participants and their parents were interviewed to determine symptoms of mental disorders. Results: Personality traits were general and specific risk indicators for mental disorders at 14 years. Increased specificity was obtained when investigating the likelihood of mental disorders over a 2-year period, with the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale showing incremental validity over the NEO Personality Inventory. Attentional biases to emotional faces did not characterise or predict mental disorders examined in the current sample. Discussion: Personality traits can indicate concurrent and prospective risk for mental disorders in a community youth sample, and identify at-risk youth beyond the impact of baseline symptoms. This study does not support the hypothesis that attentional biases mediate the relationship between personality and psychopathology in a community sample.

Although a number of other meta-analytic reviews exist, the purpose of the present meta-analysis is to examine issues unaddressed in prior reviews. Specifically, the review estimates the efficacy of ABMT in clinically anxious patients and examines the effect of delivery context (clinic vs. home) on symptom reduction. Methods A literature search using PsychInfo and Web of Science databases was performed. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining dot-probe-based ABMT in clinically diagnosed anxious patients were included. From 714 articles located through the search, 36 ABMT studies were identified and 11 studies met inclusion criteria (N = 589 patients). Results ABMT was associated with greater clinician-rated reductions in anxiety symptoms relative to control training: between-groups effect (d = 0.42, P =.001, confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.66), contrast of within-group effects (Q = 7.25, P <.01). More patients in the treatment group no longer met formal diagnostic criteria for their anxiety disorder posttreatment relative to patients in the control condition (P <.05). Analyses of patients' self-reported anxiety were nonsignificant for the between-groups contrast (P =.35), and were at a trend level of significance for the contrast between the within-group effects (P =.06). Moderation analysis of the between-groups effect revealed a significant effect for ABMT delivered in the clinic (d = 0.34, P = 0.01, CI = 0.07-0.62), and a nonsignificant effect for ABMT delivered at home (d = -0.10, P = 0.40, CI = -0.33-0.13). Conclusions The current meta-analysis provides support for ABMT as a novel evidenced-based treatment for anxiety disorders. Overall, ABMT effects are mainly evident when it is delivered in the clinic and when clinical outcome is evaluated by a clinician. More RCTs of ABMT in specific anxiety disorders are warranted. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anxiety; anxiety disorders; clinical trials; cognition; computer; Internet technology; treatment","anxiety disorder; attention bias modification treatment; attentional bias; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical evaluation; cognition; cognitive therapy; depression; health care delivery; home care; hospital care; human; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; meta analysis; outcome assessment; priority journal; Review; self report; therapy effect; Anxiety Disorders; attention; behavior therapy; controlled study; randomized controlled trial; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistical bias; treatment outcome; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Behavior Therapy; Bias (Epidemiology); Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self Report; Treatment Outcome",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929506544

A modified dot-probe protocol has been shown to reduce SAD symptoms, in some but not all studies, presumably by modifying an attentional bias. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to replicate and extend such research. Participants included treatment-seeking adults (. n=. 108; 58% women) who met diagnostic criteria for SAD. Participants were randomly assigned to a standard (i.e., control) or modified (i.e., active) dot-probe protocol condition and to participate in-lab or at home. The protocol involved twice-weekly 15-min sessions, for 4 weeks, with questionnaires completed at baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. Symptom reports were assessed with repeated measures mixed hierarchical modeling. There was a main effect of time from baseline to post-treatment wherein social anxiety symptoms declined significantly (. p<. .05) but depression and trait anxiety did not (. p>. .05). There were no significant interactions based on condition or participation location (. ps. >. .05). Reductions were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Symptom reductions were not correlated with threat biases as indexed by the dot-probe task. The modified and standard protocol both produced significant sustained symptom reductions, whether administered in-lab or at home. There were no robust differences based on protocol type. As such, the mechanisms for benefits associated with modified dot-probe protocols warrant additional research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention modification protocol; Attentional bias; Longitudinal study; Randomized controlled trial; Social anxiety disorder","adult; Article; attention modification; attentional bias; cognitive therapy; controlled study; depression; female; follow up; help seeking behavior; home care; human; laboratory; major clinical study; male; mental task; psychologic assessment; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; self report; social phobia; task performance; treatment duration; treatment outcome; analysis of variance; anxiety; attention; cognitive therapy; depression; longitudinal study; Phobic Disorders; physiology; procedures; psychology; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Phobic Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","SHRF2456, SHRF, Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation","The authors would like to thank the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation for making this research possible through a New Investigator Establishment Grant and a New Investigator Equipment Grant ( SHRF2456 ) awarded to R.

To date, less research has examined whether momentary decreases in alcohol craving are associated with reductions in attentional bias. One experimental manipulation that has been used to produce within-session decreases in alcohol craving is to extend the duration of laboratory-based alcohol-cue exposure protocols. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of both brief and extended alcohol-cue exposure on subjective craving and attentional bias among UCSDs. Eighty participants were randomized either to a group that received a short, in vivo, alcohol-cue-exposure period (short-exposure group [SE], 2 3-min blocks) or to a group that received a long-exposure period (long-exposure group [LE], 6 3-min blocks). Both groups completed a visual probe task before and after cue exposure to assess changes in attentional bias. Analyses revealed no group differences in mean craving or mean attentional bias before or after cue exposure. Further, exploratory analyses revealed no sex differences in our measures of craving or attentional bias. For Group LE, but not Group SE, within-session changes in craving positively predicted within-session changes in attentional bias. However, further analyses revealed that this relationship was significant only for women in the LE group.

Specifically, numerous articles claimed to demonstrate either that (1) attentional bias measured in treatment settings could predict subsequent relapse to substance use, or (2) direct modification of attentional bias reduced substance use and improved treatment outcomes. In this paper, we critically evaluate empirical studies that investigated these issues. We show that the evidence regarding both of these claims is decidedly mixed, and that many of the studies that appear to yield positive findings have serious methodological and statistical limitations. We contend that the available literature suggests that attentional bias for drug cues fluctuates within individuals because it is an output of the underlying motivational state at that moment in time, but there is no convincing evidence that it exerts a causal influence on substance use.

Previous work has provided evidence that feature-based attentional templates affect visual processing globally across the visual field. In the present study, we asked whether more naturalistic, category-level attentional templates also modulate visual processing in a spatially global and obligatory way. Subjects were cued to detect people or cars in a diverse set of photographs of real-world scenes. On a subset of trials, silhouettes of people and cars appeared in search-irrelevant locations that subjects were instructed to ignore, and subjects were required to respond to the location of a subsequent dot probe. In three experiments, results showed a consistency effect on dot-probe trials: dot probes were detected faster when they appeared in the location of the cued category compared with the non-cued category, indicating attentional capture by template-matching stimuli. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that this capture was involuntary: consistency effects persisted under conditions in which attending to silhouettes of the cued category was detrimental to performance. Experiment 3 tested whether these effects could be attributed to non-attentional effects related to the processing of the category cues. Results showed a consistency effect when subjects searched for category exemplars but not when they searched for objects semantically related to the cued category. Together, these results indicate that attentional templates for familiar object categories affect visual processing across the visual field, leading to involuntary attentional capture by template-matching stimuli. © 2015, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Attention; Attentional capture; Visual search","adult; association; attention; controlled study; female; human; male; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; psychologic test; psychomotor performance; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; visual field; young adult; Adult; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Visual Fields; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940000056

Methods: Data were used from a two-year, four-wave online sample of 378 Dutch young adolescents (mean age 14.9. years, 64.8% female). With zero-inflated Poisson regression analysis we prospectively predicted weekly alcohol use using baseline cognitive biases. Additionally, multiple regression analyses were used to prospectively predict the emergence of alcohol-specific cognitive biases by baseline impulsivity and alcohol use. Results: Zero-inflated Poisson analyses demonstrated that the Visual Probe Task reliably predicted weekly alcohol use at different time points. Baseline alcohol use and baseline impulsivity measures did generally not predict alcohol-specific cognitive biases. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicated that while certain measures of alcohol-related attentional bias predicted later alcohol use in young adolescents, approach biases did not. Baseline measures of impulsivity and alcohol use did not predict later alcohol-related cognitive biases.

The ingestion of probiotics modulates the processing of information that is strongly linked to anxiety and depression, and influences the neuroendocrine stress response. We have recently demonstrated that prebiotics (soluble fibres that augment the growth of indigenous microbiota) have significant neurobiological effects in rats, but their action in humans has not been reported. Objectives: The present study explored the effects of two prebiotics on the secretion of the stress hormone, cortisol and emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty-five healthy volunteers received one of two prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides, FOS, or Bimuno®-galactooligosaccharides, B-GOS) or a placebo (maltodextrin) daily for 3 weeks. The salivary cortisol awakening response was sampled before and after prebiotic/placebo administration. On the final day of treatment, participants completed a computerised task battery assessing the processing of emotionally salient information. Results: The salivary cortisol awakening response was significantly lower after B-GOS intake compared with placebo. Participants also showed decreased attentional vigilance to negative versus positive information in a dot-probe task after B-GOS compared to placebo intake. No effects were found after the administration of FOS. Conclusion: The suppression of the neuroendocrine stress response and the increase in the processing of positive versus negative attentional vigilance in subjects supplemented with B-GOS are consistent with previous findings of endocrine and anxiolytic effects of microbiota proliferation.

The aim of our study was to assess the attentional capture by red-colored images, and to explore the modulatory role of the emotional valence in this process, as postulated by Elliot and Maier (2012) color-in-context theory. Participants completed a dot-probe task with each cue comprising two images of equal valence and arousal, one containing a prominent red object and the other an object of different coloration. Reaction times were measured, as well as the event-related lateralizations of the EEG. Modulation of the lateralized components revealed that the color red captured and later held the attention in both positive and negative conditions, but not in a neutral condition. An overt motor response to the target stimulus was affected mainly by attention lingering over the visual field where the red cue had been flashed. However, a weak influence of the valence could still be detected in reaction times. Therefore, red seems to guide attention, specifically in emotionally-valenced circumstances, indicating that an emotional context can alter color’s impact both on attention and motor behavior. © 2015 Kuniecki, Pilarczyk and Wichary.","Attention; Emotion; Event-related potentials; The color red; Visual perception","adult; Article; association; attention; color discrimination; color vision; controlled study; electroencephalography; emotion; emotionality; event related potential; female; hemispheric dominance; human; human experiment; locomotion; male; mental task; response time; stimulus response; task performance; visual discrimination; visual field; visual stimulation; young adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933675504

However, the underlying processes accounting for this effect remain poorly understood. One explanation suggests that ABM requires the modification of attention control, driven by the recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In the present double-blind study, we examined whether modifying left DLPFC activation influences the effect of ABM on AB. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to directly modulate cortical excitability of the left DLPFC during an ABM procedure designed to reduce AB to threat. Anodal tDCS increases excitability, whereas cathodal tDCS decreases it. We randomly assigned highly trait-anxious individuals to one of three conditions: 1) ABM combined with cathodal tDCS, 2) ABM combined with anodal tDCS, or 3) ABM combined with sham tDCS. We assessed the effects of these manipulations on both reaction times and eye-movements on a task indexing AB. Results indicate that combining ABM and anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC reduces the total duration that participants' gaze remains fixated on threat, as assessed using eye-tracking measurement. However, in contrast to previous studies, there were no changes in AB from baseline to post-training for participants that received ABM without tDCS. As the tendency to maintain attention to threat is known to play an important role in the maintenance of anxiety, the present findings suggest that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC may be considered as a promising tool to reduce the maintenance of gaze to threat. Implications for future translational research combining ABM and tDCS are discussed. © 2015 Heeren et al.",,"adult; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; eye fixation; eye movement; eye tracking; female; gaze; human; human experiment; nerve cell stimulation; prefrontal cortex; response time; transcranial direct current stimulation; adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; attention; double blind procedure; oculography; pathophysiology; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Double-Blind Method; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Prefrontal Cortex; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929454678

The self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) model suggests that metacognitions and attentional bias to cancer-related words may explain high FCR. Thus, this study aimed to explore relationships between FCR, metacognitions and attentional bias in a mixed group of cancer survivors. Method Sixty-three early-stage breast or prostate cancer survivors, diagnosed within 6 months to 5 years prior to participation and who had completed all hospital-based treatment with no evidence of cancer recurrence were recruited through two metropolitan oncology clinics. Participants completed a questionnaire battery and the dot-probe task. Results Survivors with clinical FCR had significantly greater positive beliefs about worry (10.1 vs 7.4, p = 0.002) and beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry (12.0 vs 7.7, p = 0.000) than those with non-clinical FCR, whereas the total metacognition score significantly predicted FCR in multiple regression analysis (β = 0.371, p = 0.001). No significant differences were detected between participants scoring above and below clinical FCR levels in attention bias indices. Conclusions This study found partial support for the S-REF model of FCR, with metacognitions but not attentional bias found to be related to FCR.

Predicting an individual's long-term clinical response therefore remains an important challenge. This study aimed at assessing neural predictors of long-term treatment outcome in participants with SAD 1 year after completion of Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT). Twenty-six participants diagnosed with SAD underwent iCBT including attention bias modification for a total of 13 weeks. Support vector machines (SVMs), a supervised pattern recognition method allowing predictions at the individual level, were trained to separate long-term treatment responders from nonresponders based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to self-referential criticism. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale was the main instrument to determine treatment response at the 1-year follow-up. Results showed that the proportion of long-term responders was 52% (12/23). From multivariate BOLD responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) together with the amygdala, we were able to predict long-term response rate of iCBT with an accuracy of 92% (confidence interval 95% 73.2-97.6). This activation pattern was, however, not predictive of improvement in the continuous Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-report version. Follow-up psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that lower dACC-amygdala coupling was associated with better long-term treatment response. Thus, BOLD response patterns in the fear-expressing dACC-amygdala regions were highly predictive of long-term treatment outcome of iCBT, and the initial coupling between these regions differentiated long-term responders from nonresponders. The SVM-neuroimaging approach could be of particular clinical value as it allows for accurate prediction of treatment outcome at the level of the individual.",,"adult; Anxiety Disorders; brain; brain mapping; cognitive therapy; computer assisted therapy; female; human; Internet; machine learning; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Internet; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016518389

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-49229-001.) The dot-probe task has been widely used in research to produce an index of biased attention based on reaction times (RTs). Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we used dot-probe data from 3 studies in which attention bias toward threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (?5) time-points. Two of the studies were similar (adults with social anxiety disorder, similar design features) whereas 1 was more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score formula, outlier handling method) on reliability and searched for convergent findings across the 3 studies. We found that, when concurrently considering the 3 studies, the most reliable RT index of bias used data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than 1 assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias indices was moderate to low, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV). On the basis of these findings, we make specific recommendations to researchers using the dot-probe, particularly those wishing to investigate individual differences and/or single-patient applications.

A recent study in our laboratory (Weafer &Fillmore, 2013) showed that alcohol decreases attentional bias among heavy drinkers, suggesting that alcohol satiates motivation to drink in heavy drinkers. Little is known, however, about how this satiety effect might change across the time course of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve. It is possible that attentional bias may return later in the time course if the satiety effect begins to diminish. The current study tested this hypothesis in a group of high-risk binge drinkers (n = 20). Participants completed a visual-probe task to measure their attentional bias and a self-report measure of their desire for alcohol after receiving 0.64 g/kg and 0.0 g/kg alcohol (placebo) during separate dose challenge sessions. The measures were obtained during the ascending limb of the BAC curve under alcohol (Test 1) and again during the descending limb (Test 2) at a comparable BAC. The measures also were obtained at the same times following placebo. Under alcohol, no attentional bias was observed during Test 1, but drinkers reported increased desire to drink. During Test 2, attentional bias was evident, but participants reported less desire to drink. Attentional bias was not correlated with desire to drink at any time point. Following placebo, attentional bias was evident during both tests. These findings show that alcohol causes a temporary reduction of attentional bias among heavy drinkers. These changes do not correspond with their self-reported motivation to drink. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Acute tolerance; Alcohol effects; Attentional bias; Binge drinkers; Implicit cognition","alcohol; placebo; alcohol; alcohol blood level; adult; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; alcohol intoxication; Article; attentional bias; behavior change; controlled study; correlation analysis; drinking behavior; female; human; male; motivation; self report; task performance; alcohol blood level; attention; binge drinking; blood; drug effects; motivation; pathophysiology; physiology; psychomotor performance; young adult; Adult; Attention; Binge Drinking; Blood Alcohol Content; Ethanol; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Psychomotor Performance; Young Adult","R01AA018274, NIH, National Institutes of Health",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941093424

These automatic processes include the tendency to attend and approach alcohol cues. These biases may be trained away from alcohol via computerised cognitive bias modification (CBM). The present protocol describes the design of a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of attentional bias and approach bias re-training with a 2×2 factorial design, alongside a brief motivational support (MS) program. Methods/Design: Participants (n=120) are adult alcohol dependent outpatients, recruited from a public health service for addiction in Italy, who have been abstinent for at least two months, and with a main diagnosis of alcohol dependence disorder. Participants are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions and complete 11 sessions of training after a baseline assessment. The MS takes place before each training session. Post-intervention and three-month follow-up assessments examine the change in clinical outcome variables and attentional and approach biases (measured with the Visual Probe Task and the Approach-Avoidance Task, respectively). Alcohol approach-avoidance implicit memory associations (measured with the Brief Implicit Association Test) are also evaluated at pre- and post-intervention to explore generalisation effects. Primary outcome measure is relapse rate at follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include change in cognitive biases, in alcohol-related implicit memory associations, and in the clinical variables assessed. An exploratory analysis is also planned to detect interaction effects between the CBM modules and possible moderators (interference control capacity, gender, age, number of previous detoxifications) and mediators (change in cognitive bias) of the primary outcome measure. Discussion: This RCT is the first to test the effectiveness of a combined CBM intervention alongside motivational support in alcohol-dependent outpatients. The results of this study can be extremely valuable for future research in the optimisation of CBM treatment for alcohol addiction.

However, whether and how selective attention - in terms of suppression and enhancement - operates in this context has remained unclear. To examine the dynamic interplay of selective attention and cognitive control we used electrophysiological measures and presented task-irrelevant visual probe stimuli at foveal, parafoveal, and peripheral display positions. Target-flanker congruency varied either randomly from trial to trial (mixed-block) or block-wise (fixed-block) in order to induce reactive versus proactive control modes, respectively. Three EEG measures were used to capture ad-hoc adjustments within trials as well as effects of context-based predictions: the N1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP) to probes, the VEP to targets, and the conflict-related midfrontal N2 component.Results from probe-VEPs indicate that enhanced processing of the foveal target rather than suppression of the peripheral flankers supports interference control. In incongruent mixed-block trials VEPs were larger to probes near the targets. In the fixed-blocks probe-VEPs were not modulated, but contrary to the mixed-block the preceding target-related VEP was affected by congruency. Results of the control-related N2 reveal largest amplitudes in the unpredictable context, which did not differentiate for stimulus and response incongruency. In contrast, in the predictable context, N2 amplitudes were reduced overall and differentiated between stimulus and response incongruency.Taken together these results imply that predictability alters interference control by a reconfiguration of stimulus processing. During unpredictable sequences participants adjust their attentional focus dynamically on a trial-by-trial basis as reflected in congruency-dependent probe-VEP-modulation. This reactive control mode also elicits larger N2 amplitudes. In contrast, when task demands are predictable, participants focus selective attention earlier as reflected in the target-related VEPs. This proactive control mode leads to smaller N2 amplitudes and absent probe effects. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive control; Flanker task; N200; Selective attention; Visual evoked potentials (VEP)","adult; Article; conflict; controlled study; electroencephalogram; evoked visual response; executive function; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; prediction; response time; selective attention; sensory gating; visual stimulation; adolescent; anticipation; attention; electroencephalography; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; reading; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Attention; Conflict (Psychology); Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Reading; Young Adult","DFG-FOR 778, DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","The authors thank Benthe Kornrumpf for helpful suggestions regarding the measurement of probe-VEPs.

One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias specificity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content specificity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias Modification Treatments (ABMT). Content specificity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identified 37 samples from 29 articles (N = 866). Relevant data were extracted based on specific coding rules, and Cohen'. s d effect size was used to estimate bias specificity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorder-incongruent threat stimuli (d = 0.28, p< 0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed.

A number of studies have successfully implemented ABM using the modified dot-probe task. However others have not achieved the attentional change required to achieve emotional benefits, highlighting the need for new ABM methods. The current study compared the effectiveness of a newly developed ABM task against the traditional dot-probe ABM task. The new person-identity-matching (PIM) task presented participants with virtual cards, each depicting a happy and angry person. The task encourages selective attention toward or away from threat by requiring participants to make matching judgements between two cards, based either on the identities of the happy faces, or of the angry faces. Change in attentional bias achieved by both ABM tasks was measured by a dot-probe assessment task. Their impact on emotional vulnerability was assessed by measuring negative emotional reactions to a video stressor. The PIM task succeeded in modifying attentional bias, and exerting an impact on emotional reactivity, whereas this was not the case for the dot-probe task. These results are considered in relation to the potential clinical utility of the current task in comparison to traditional ABM methodologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Attentional bias modification; Cognitive bias; Emotional disorders","adult; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; decision making; dot probe task; emotionality; female; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; male; neurologic examination; neuropsychological test; person identity matching task; selective attention; task performance; validation study; young adult; adolescent; anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; attention; behavior therapy; emotion; physiology; procedures; psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Behavior Therapy; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult","Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045, UEFISCDI, Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii; DP140103713, UEFISCDI, Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii; DP140104448, ARC, Australian Research Council; CNCS, Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice","Lies Notebaert is supported by an Australian Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre grant on managing threat through the modification of thought.

After the offset a visual probe (a dot) was presented either at the previous position of the emotionally relevant or the neutral slide and participants were asked to indicate with a button press whether the dot had been presented on the left or the right side of the screen. Results revealed a modulation of the centro-parietal P300 (340-500. ms after picture onset). Amplitudes were higher when the dot replaced a spider than when it replaced a neutral picture. This was phobia-specific, as it was only present in phobics and did not appear in response to disgust pictures. Moreover, the modulation could only be shown for short presentation times. The results are interpreted to reflect motivated attention in spider phobia, if disorder-relevant and neutral pictures are shown simultaneously. As the modulation of the P300 was found after picture offset, attentional allocation seems to be persist after the phobic object is no longer present. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Dot probe; ERP; LPP; Motivated attention; P300; Spider phobia","action potential; adult; Article; association; attentional bias; avoidance behavior; clinical article; controlled study; disgust; dot probe task; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; human; neuromodulation; phobia; psychologic test; response time; spider phobia; task performance; validation study; validity; visual stimulation; young adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917690921

Laboratory experiments have shown that manipulating attentional bias may change craving. Interventions to reduce attentional bias could reduce relapse in smokers seeking to quit. We report a clinical trial of attentional retraining in treatment-seeking smokers. Methods: This was a double-blind randomised controlled trial that took place in UK smoking cessation clinics. Smokers interested in quitting were randomised to five weekly sessions of attentional retraining (N= 60) or placebo training (N= 58) using a modified visual probe task from one week prior to quit day. Both groups received 21. mg nicotine patches (from quit day onwards) and behavioural support. Primary outcomes included change in attentional bias reaction times four weeks after quit day on the visual probe task and craving measured weekly using the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in withdrawal symptoms, time to first lapse and prolonged abstinence. Results: No attentional bias towards smoking cues was found in the sample at baseline (mean difference = 3. ms, 95% CI = -2, 9). Post-training bias was not significantly lower in the retraining group compared with the placebo group (mean difference = -9. ms, 95% CI = -20, 2). There was no difference between groups in change in craving (p= 0.89) and prolonged abstinence at four weeks (risk ratio = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.70, 1.43). Conclusions: Taken with one other trial, there appears to be no effect from clinic-based attentional retraining using the visual probe task. Attentional retraining conducted out of clinic may prove more effective. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Attentional bias; Attentional retraining; Cigarette smoking; Craving; Smoking cessation","nicotine patch; placebo; nicotine gum; adult; Article; attentional bias; attentional retraining; behavior therapy; behavioral support; controlled study; double blind procedure; human; Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; psychological rating scale; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation; United Kingdom; withdrawal syndrome; association; attention; behavior therapy; female; male; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; psychology; reaction time; time; Tobacco Use Disorder; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Attention; Behavior Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Craving; Cues; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reaction Time; Smoking Cessation; Time Factors; Tobacco Use Cessation Products; Tobacco Use Disorder; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; DRF-2009-02-15, NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; DH, Department of Health; Pfizer","The study was funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Doctoral Research Fellowship ( DRF-2009-02-15 ) awarded to Rachna Begh.

A non-clinical sample of participants was randomly assigned to receive either ABM or a placebo task. To assess pre-post changes in attentional control, participants were additionally administered an emotional antisaccade task. ABM participants exhibited a subsequent shift in attentional bias away from threat as expected. ABM participants further showed a subsequent decrease in antisaccade cost, indicating a general facilitation of inhibitory attentional control.

Twenty-seven participants in group cognitive behavioural therapy (GCBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) were randomly assigned to undergo six sessions of a dot-probe task consisting of ABM or placebo ABM along with random or high reward following neutral stimuli. There was no influence of ABM on participants' attention bias over and above the influence of GCBT. Reward, however, had a strong influence on attention bias.

In this review, we comment on recent research that may help explain some of the inconsistencies across ABM studies. More relevant to the future of ABM research, we highlight areas in which continuing research is needed. We suggest that ABM appears to be a promising treatment for anxiety disorders, but relative to other interventions, ABM is in its infancy.

However, reported therapeutic benefits have not always been replicated. To gauge the sensitivity of tasks used in ABM treatment and assessment, we used a counterbalanced within-subject design to measure their discriminant sensitivity to neutral and threatening facial expressions, comparing them with other well-known tasks that measure visual attention. Methods We compared two tasks often used in the assessment and treatment of attention bias (the dot-probe and the spatial cueing paradigms) with two well-known visual attention tasks (the irrelevant singleton and attentional blink paradigms), measuring their sensitivity to processing differences between threatening and neutral expressions for non-clinical observers. Results The dot-probe, spatial cueing and irrelevant singleton paradigms showed little or no sensitivity to processing differences between facial expressions while the attentional blink task proved very sensitive to such differences. Furthermore, the attentional blink task provided an intriguing picture of the temporal dynamics of attentional biases that the other paradigms cannot do. Limitations These results need to be replicated with larger samples, including a comparison of a group of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and normal controls. Conclusions Our results indicate that the sensitivity of putative attentional bias measures should be assessed experimentally for more powerful assessment and treatment of such biases. If the attentional blink task is indeed particularly sensitive to attentional biases, as our findings indicate, it is not unreasonable to expect that interventions based on this task may be more effective than those based on the tasks that are currently used. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It was designed to facilitate attentional disengagement from threatening stimuli in socially anxious individuals (N = 15). The following outcomes were examined: (a) self-reports of enjoyment, motivation, flow, and presence; (b) attentional bias for social stimuli; and (c) social anxiety symptoms. Results showed that ABM training is associated with high scores in enjoyment, motivation, flow, and presence. Furthermore, significant improvements in terms of attention bias and social anxiety symptoms were observed from pre- to follow-up assessment.

This is likely impacting progress that can be made in terms of interventions focused on modifying this bias and reducing anxiety, namely attention bias modification training. We suggest that the field may need to ""take a step back"" from developing interventions and focus research efforts on improving the methodology of studying attention bias itself, particularly in a developmental context.

Cognitive training procedures designed to modify selective attentional responding to threat originally were developed to test the hypothesis that this attentional bias causally contributes to anxious disposition. The capacity of attentional bias modification (ABM) training to alleviate dysfunctional anxiety has since attracted growing interest, and the present article reviews studies that have evaluated this therapeutic potential. When intended ABM training has successfully reduced attention to threat, it also has reduced anxiety vulnerability and symptomatology with a high degree of reliability. When the delivery of intended ABM training has not resulted in such anxiety reduction, this typically has reflected the failure to successfully modify attentional selectivity as required.

This relationship has been a highly synergistic one. Refinements to knowledge that have resulted from basic experimentation have continuously been translated into practice in the field, whereas the findings from applied clinical intervention studies have served to strongly guide the questions that have been addressed within the laboratory.

Methods Participants were randomized to receive either training towards or away from painful faces or words. Following training, participants completed the cold pressor task. Results The results confirm that attention bias modification produced the predicted changes in attentional biases. Clear training effects were observed for words and faces, such that attentional biases changed in the predicted direction on the stimuli presented during the training. However, for those trained on words, training effects also generalized to face stimuli. As predicted, those who received training away from painful stimuli took longer to report pain (higher pain threshold) during the cold pressor task, and this effect was more pronounced for those trained on words. Contrary to expectations, those trained on faces (regardless of training direction) reported less pain than those trained on words. There were no differences between the groups for pain tolerance (length of time participants were able to keep their arms in the cold pressor). Conclusions These findings confirm that attentional biases are modifiable, and impact (in the expected manner) how quickly participants perceive pain. Further, exposure to painful faces resulted in additional benefits to the level of pain reported. However, we were unable to confirm that change in attentional biases was the mechanism of change. © 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.",,"adolescent; adult; Article; attention bias modification; attentional bias; cold pressor test; controlled study; expectation; experimental pain; female; gender; human; human experiment; male; normal human; outcome assessment; pain assessment; pain intensity; pain threshold; priority journal; stimulus; training away from painful face; training away from painful word; training towards painful face; training towards painful word; Acute Pain; attention; facial expression; nociception; outcome assessment; physiology; procedures; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Acute Pain; Adult; Attention; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pain Perception; Pain Threshold; Psychotherapy; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942295507

Attention bias modification (ABM) procedure may reduce this bias, thereby diminishing anxiety symptoms. In ABM, participants respond to probes that reliably follow non-threatening stimuli (e.g., neutral faces) such that their attention is directed away from concurrently presented threatening stimuli (e.g., disgust faces). Early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety more than control procedures lacking any contingency between valenced stimuli and probes. However, recent work suggests that no-contingency training and training toward threat cues can be as effective as ABM in reducing anxiety, implying that any training may increase executive control over attention, thereby helping people inhibit their anxious thoughts. Extending this work, we randomly assigned participants with DSM-IV diagnosed social anxiety disorder to either training toward non-threat (ABM), training toward threat, or no-contingency condition, and we used the attention network task (ANT) to assess all three components of attention. After two training sessions, subjects in all three conditions exhibited indistinguishably significant declines from baseline to post-training in self-report and behavioral measures of anxiety on an impromptu speech task. Moreover, all groups exhibited similarly significant improvements on the alerting and executive (but not orienting) components of attention.

Recent evidence suggests that attention training towards positive stimuli, using visual-search based ABMT, has beneficial effects on anxiety and attention biases in children. The present study extends this prior research using distinctive techniques designed to increase participant learning, memory consolidation, and treatment engagement. Fifty-nine clinically anxious children were randomly assigned to the active treatment condition (ATC) (N = 31) or waitlist control condition (WLC) (N = 28). In the ATC, children completed 12 treatment sessions at home on computer in which they searched matrices for a pleasant or calm target amongst unpleasant background pictures, while also engaging in techniques designed to consolidate learning and memory for these search strategies. No contact was made with children in the WLC during the wait period. Diagnostic, parent- and child-reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms, externalising behaviour problems and attention biases were assessed pre- and post-condition and sixmonths after treatment. Children in the ATC showed greater improvements on multiple clinical measures compared to children in the WLC. Post-treatment gains improved six-months after treatment. Attention biases for angry and happy faces did not change significantly from pre-to post-condition. However, larger pre-treatment attention bias towards threat was associated with greater reduction in anxiety at post-treatment. Also, children who showed greater consolidation of learning and memory strategies during treatment achieved greater improvement in global functioning at post-treatment. Attention training towards positive stimuli using enhanced visual-search procedures appears to be a promising treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One issue that has not been resolved is whether high ratings on the PCM reflect the patient's ""criticality biases"" or are accurate reflections of how much criticism is expressed by relatives. PCM ratings are correlated with observers' reports of how critical the relative is in interactions with the patient. Therefore, an exclusive treatment focus on PCM ratings as attributional biases risks alienating the patient, who may be perceiving the behavior of relatives accurately. If the clinician opts for a family/marital approach, communication training that fosters a dialogue between the patient and spouse or parent(s) about vulnerable emotions underlying anger may lead to shifts in the patient's interpretation of the meaning of critical comments. Future research should investigate whether PC ratings are moderators of the effectiveness of family psychoeducational interventions or individual treatments that emphasize attentional bias modification. © 2015 Society of Clinical Psychology.","Anxiety disorders; Attributions; Bipolar disorder; Couple therapy, depression; Expressed emotion; Family therapy; Marital therapy",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942742032

Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we used dot-probe data from 3 studies in which attention bias toward threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (≤5) time-points. Two of the studies were similar (adults with social anxiety disorder, similar design features) whereas 1 was more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score formula, outlier handling method) on reliability and searched for convergent findings across the 3 studies. We found that, when concurrently considering the 3 studies, the most reliable RT index of bias used data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than 1 assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias indices was moderate to low, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV).

Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants' preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement fixations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time). Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eye-tracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (. α=. .73) and gaze dwell time measures (. α=. .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (. α=. .51) compared to the reaction time measure (. α=. .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure.

Accordingly, the current study aims to investigate whether attentional bias is involved in math anxiety (MA) as well (i.e., a persistent negative reaction to math). Twenty seven participants (14 with high levels of MA and 13 with low levels of MA) were presented with a novel computerized numerical version of the well established dot probe task. One of six types of prime stimuli, either math related or typically neutral, was presented on one side of a computer screen. The prime was preceded by a probe (either one or two asterisks) that appeared in either the prime or the opposite location. Participants had to discriminate probe identity (one or two asterisks). Math anxious individuals reacted faster when the probe was at the location of the numerical related stimuli. This suggests the existence of attentional bias in MA.

Theoretical accounts of narcissism suggest these heterogeneous behaviors reflect a defensive motivational style that functions to both uphold and protect the self-concept. However, the notion that narcissism can be characterized by grandiose and vulnerable dimensions raises the possibility that these diverse behaviors represent distinct expressions of narcissistic defensiveness. The present study examined whether both dimensions exhibit a general defensive style marked by selective attention to evaluative stimuli or are differentially associated with selective attention to positive and negative information, respectively. Using a dot probe task consisting of valenced and neutral trait adjectives, we evaluated these hypotheses in a group of male offenders. Results indicated that vulnerable narcissism was associated with attention biases for both positive and negative stimuli, though the dimension was further distinguished by disengagement difficulties and a greater recognition memory bias in response to negative words. Conversely, grandiose narcissism was associated with increased accuracy when attending to positive stimuli and directing attention away from negative stimuli. Overall, these findings suggest narcissistic individuals share motivated selective attention in response to evaluative stimuli, while simultaneously highlighting important phenotypic differences between grandiose and vulnerable dimensions. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","attention; dot probe task; grandiose; narcissism; vulnerable","adult; attention; human; male; narcissism; offender; pathophysiology; personality disorder; physiology; prisoner; psychology; Adult; Attention; Criminals; Humans; Male; Narcissism; Personality Disorders; Prisoners",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937773266

They can also carry biologically significant emotional information (such as unseen dangers and conspecific vocalizations), which provides cues for allocation of attention and mental resources. Here, we investigated whether task-irrelevant auditory emotional information can provide cues for orientation of auditory spatial attention. We employed a covert spatial orienting task: the dot-probe task. In each trial, two task-irrelevant auditory cues were simultaneously presented at two separate locations (left-right or front-back). Environmental sounds were selected to form emotional vs. neutral, emotional vs. emotional, and neutral vs. neutral cue pairs. The participants' task was to detect the location of an acoustic target that was presented immediately after the task-irrelevant auditory cues. The target was presented at the same location as one of the auditory cues. The results indicated that participants were significantly faster to locate the target when it replaced the negative cue compared to when it replaced the neutral cue. The positive cues did not produce a clear attentional bias. Further, same valence pairs (emotional-emotional or neutral-neutral) did not modulate reaction times due to a lack of spatial attention capture by one cue in the pair. Taken together, the results indicate that negative affect can provide cues for the orientation of spatial attention in the auditory domain. © 2015 Asutay and Västfjäll.","Auditory perception; Auditory spatial attention; Covert spatial orienting; Dot-probe task; Emotion",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930944767

Recent evidence from adult studies suggests not only that negative attention biases are correlated with symptoms of depression, but that reducing negative attention biases through training can in turn reduce symptomology. The role and plasticity of attention biases in adolescent depression, however, remains unclear. This study examines the association between symptoms of depression and attention biases, and whether such biases are modifiable, in a community sample of adolescents. We report data from 105 adolescents aged 13-17 who completed a dot-probe measure of attention bias before and after a single session of visual search-based cognitive bias modification training. This is the first study to find a significant association between negative attention biases and increased symptoms of depression in a community sample of adolescents. Contrary to expectations, we were unable to manipulate attention biases using a previously successful cognitive bias modification task. There were no significant effects of the training on positive affect and only modest effects of the training, identified in post-hoc analyses, were observed on negative affect. Our data replicate those fromthe adult literature, which suggest that adolescent depression is a disorder associated with negative attention biases, although we were unable to modify attention biases in our study. We identify numerous parameters of our methodology which may explain these null training effects, and which could be addressed in future cognitive bias modification studies of adolescent depression. © 2015 Platt et al.","Adolescent depression; Cognitive bias modification; Dot-probe task; Visual search task","adolescent; anxiety; Article; attentional bias; brain maturation; controlled study; depression; female; human; major clinical study; male; stimulus; suicidal behavior; training",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946206011

Through associative conditioning, it is hypothesized that alcohol increases incentive motivation for cocaine and thus the salience of cocaine-related cues, which are important in maintaining drug-taking behavior. Cocaine-using individuals display a robust cocaine cue attentional bias as measured by fixation time during the visual probe task. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of alcohol administration on cocaine cue attentional bias using eye-tracking technology to directly measure attentional allocation. Methods: Twenty current cocaine users completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study that tested the effect of 3 doses of alcohol (0.00, 0.325, and 0.65 g/kg) on cocaine cue attentional bias using the visual probe task with eye-tracking technology. The participant-rated and physiological effects of alcohol were also assessed. Results: Participants displayed a robust cocaine cue attentional bias following both placebo and alcohol administration as measured by fixation time, but not response time. Alcohol administration did not influence cocaine cue attentional bias, but increased craving for cocaine in a dose-dependent manner. Alcohol produced prototypic psychomotor and participant-rated effects. Conclusions: Alcohol administration increases cocaine craving but not cocaine cue attentional bias.

In the first model, it was highlighted that attention was self-focused. The relationship between threatening stimuli and attention was considered in the subsequent models. Attentional bias towards threat may take place in several ways, such as facilitated processing of threat, difficulty in disengaging attention from the threat and avoidance of attention from the threat.

In Experiments 1 and 2, each trial consisted of either a smiling or angry face that was paired with a neutral face. In Experiment 1, when the stimulus onset-asynchronies (SOA) were 500 ms, the inhibition of return emerged, indirectly indicating that social exclusion promotes sensitivity to social acceptance cues.

Attention bias may moderate the relationship between violence exposure and anxiety in young children.

Methods Young children (mean age 4.7, ±0.8) from a cross-sectional sample oversampled for violence exposure (N = 218) completed the dot-probe task to assess their attention biases. Observed fear/anxiety was characterized with a novel observational paradigm, the Anxiety Dimensional Observation Scale. Mother-reported symptoms were assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children. Violence exposure was characterized with dimensional scores reflecting probability of membership in two classes derived via latent class analysis from the Conflict Tactics Scales: Abuse and Harsh Parenting. Results Family violence predicted greater child anxiety and trauma symptoms. Attention bias moderated the relationship between violence and anxiety. Conclusions Attention bias toward threat may strengthen the effects of family violence on the development of anxiety, with potentially cascading effects across childhood.

Furthermore, some theories propose a relationship between craving and attention, such that cue-induced increases in craving bias attention toward alcohol cues, which, in turn, perpetuates craving. This study examined the extent to which alcohol cues induce craving and bias attention toward alcohol cues among underage college-student drinkers. We designed withinsubject cue-reactivity and visual-probe tasks to assess in vivo alcohol-cue exposure effects on craving and attentional bias on 39 undergraduate college drinkers (ages 18-20). Participants expressed greater subjective craving to drink alcohol following in vivo cue exposure to a commonly consumed beer compared with water exposure. Furthermore, following alcohol-cue exposure, participants exhibited greater attentional biases toward alcohol cues as measured by a visual-probe task. In addition to the cue-exposure effects on craving and attentional bias, within-subject differences in craving across sessions marginally predicted within-subject differences in attentional bias.

Drawing from identity-based motivation (Oyserman, 2009; Reed, et al., 2012) we suggest individuals use attention to enhance identity-fit; selectively focusing on cues and stimuli that are identity-consistent. In two studies we find that activating a social identity drives preferential attention toward identity-relevant stimuli. Using a novel paradigm, Study 1 demonstrates that individuals strategically focus attention on identity-consistent emotional stimuli, while also shifting attention away from identity-inconsistent emotional stimuli. Using a dot-probe paradigm, Study 2 extends these results to show that individuals allocate attention toward both emotional and non-emotional (semantic associates) stimuli that are identity-consistent, and away from those that are incompatible. Consistent with theories suggesting cognition and perception are constructed (James, 1890/1983) and that identities direct and influence meaning-making (Oyserman, 2009; Reed et al., 2012), we find that social identities drive attention allocation, with identity-consistent stimuli receiving greater attention; suggesting that an identity's sense-making begins with motivated attention toward perceiving an identity-consistent environment. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Attention; Emotion; Social identity",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937640011

Activity in these systems can be measured through salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol, respectively. Theoretical work and empirical studies have suggested the importance of examining the coordination of these systems in relation to cognitive functioning and behavior problems. Less is known, however, about whether these systems interactively predict more automatic aspects of attention processing such as attention toward emotionally salient threatening stimuli. We used a dot probe task to assess attention bias toward threatening stimuli in 347 kindergarten children. Cortisol and sAA were assayed from saliva samples collected prior to children's participation in assessments on a subsequent day. Using regression analyses, we examined relations of sAA and cortisol to attention bias. Results indicate that cortisol and sAA interact in predicting attention bias. Higher levels of cortisol predicted greater bias toward threat for children who had high levels of sAA, but predicted greater bias away from threat for children who had low levels of sAA. These results suggest that greater symmetry in HPA and ANS functioning is associated with greater reliance on automatic attention processes in the face of threat. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Attention bias; Cortisol; Early childhood; Salivary alpha-amylase","alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; hydrocortisone; alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; hydrocortisone; Article; attention; attentional bias; child; facilitation; female; human; kindergarten; male; maximum likelihood method; preschool child; questionnaire; saliva analysis; stimulus; threat; attention; chemistry; emotion; mental stress; photostimulation; psychologic test; regression analysis; saliva; vision; Attention; Child, Preschool; Emotions; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Regression Analysis; Saliva; Salivary alpha-Amylases; Stress, Psychological; Visual Perception","R305B080019, ED, U.S. Department of Education; R305A1000058, IES, Institute of Education Sciences; NYU, New York University","The research reported in this publication was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences Grant R305A1000058 .

Military training is a chronic stressful period that often induces stress-related psychopathology. Stress vulnerability and resilience depend on personality trait anxiety, attentional threat bias and prefrontal-limbic dysfunction. However, how these neurobehavioral elements interact with regard to the development of symptoms following stress remains unclear. Method. Fifty-five healthy combat soldiers undergoing intensive military training completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) testing while performing the dot-probe task (DPT) composed of angry (threat) and neutral faces. Participants were then stratified according to their bias tendency to avoidance (n = 25) or vigilance (n = 30) groups, categorized as high or low trait anxiety and assessed for post-stress symptom severity. Results. Avoidance compared to vigilance tendency was associated with fewer post-trauma symptoms and increased hippocampal response to threat among high anxious but not low anxious individuals. Importantly, mediation analysis revealed that only among high anxious individuals did hippocampal activity lead to lower levels of symptoms through avoidance bias tendency. However, in the whole group, avoidance bias was modulated by the interplay between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Conclusions. Our results provide a neurobehavioral model to explain the resilience to post-trauma symptoms following chronic exposure. The model points to the importance of considering threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and symptoms of trauma. Such a multi-parametric approach that accounts for individual behavioral sensitivities may also improve brain-driven treatments of anxiety, possibly by targeting the interplay between the hippocampus and the dACC.

Observation is essential to clinical assessment and can help differentiate normative variation from clinically significant anxiety. Yet, most anxiety assessment methods for young children rely on parent-reports. The goal of this article is to present and preliminarily test the reliability and validity of a novel observational paradigm for assessing a range of fearful and anxious behaviors in young children, the Anxiety Dimensional Observation Schedule (Anx-DOS). Methods A diverse sample of 403 children, aged 3 to 6 years, and their mothers was studied. Reliability and validity in relation to parent reports (Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment) and known risk factors, including indicators of behavioral inhibition (latency to touch novel objects) and attention bias to threat (in the dot-probe task) were investigated. Results The Anx-DOS demonstrated good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. Evidence for convergent validity was demonstrated relative to mother-reported separation anxiety, social anxiety, phobic avoidance, trauma symptoms, and past service use. Finally, fearfulness was associated with observed latency and attention bias toward threat. Conclusions Findings support the Anx-DOS as a method for capturing early manifestations of fearfulness and anxiety in young children.

However, both relatively high and low levels of attentional bias may increase disagreement between patients and caregivers in reporting pain behaviors. This study aims to provide further evidence for the presence of attentional bias to pain among family caregivers, to examine the association between caregivers' attentional bias to pain and detecting pain behaviors, and test whether caregivers' attentional bias to pain is curvilinearly related to patient and caregiver disagreement in reporting pain behaviors. The sample consisted of 96 caregivers, 94 patients with chronic pain, and 42 control participants. Caregivers and controls completed a dot-probe task assessing attention to painful and happy stimuli. Both patients and caregivers completed a checklist assessing patients' pain behavior. Although caregivers did not respond faster to pain congruent than pain incongruent trials, caregiver responses were slower in pain incongruent trials compared with happy incongruent trials. Caregivers showed more bias toward pain faces than happy faces, whereas control participants showed more bias toward happy faces than pain faces. Importantly, caregivers' attentional bias to pain was significantly positively associated with reporting pain behaviors in patients above and beyond pain severity. It is reassuring that attentional bias to pain was not related to disagreement between patients and caregivers in reporting pain behaviors. In other words, attentional bias does not seem to cause overestimation of pain signals. © 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.","Attentional bias; Chronic pain patients; Family caregivers; Pain behaviors","adult; Article; attentional bias; behavior; caregiver; chronic pain; controlled study; facial expression; female; gesture; human; major clinical study; male; pain; pain severity; priority journal; attention; caregiver; middle aged; pain; pain measurement; photostimulation; physiology; prejudice; procedures; psychology; reaction time; standards; young adult; Adult; Attention; Caregivers; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Measurement; Photic Stimulation; Prejudice; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942608823

Attentional biases to threat-related stimuli are thought to impact one’s ability to recognize future risk in his or her environment and may explain high rates of revictimization. Although the literature has identified three possible types of attentional biases among victims of trauma (i.e., interference, facilitation, and avoidance), findings are mixed. The current study examined attentional biases to threats among a sample of men and women with no, some, and multiple incident interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma histories. It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate an interference effect (i.e., slower response times to threat-related words). Participants (N = 309) were 18- to 29-year-old college students. Self-report measures assessed trauma history, posttraumatic stress, and other psychological sequelae. Attentional biases were assessed using a dot probe computer task. Contrary to hypotheses, no significant differences in response times in the presence of threat-related words or neutral words were found among groups.

Yet it is unclear whether these changes constitute an endophenotype for depression and are also present in healthy individuals with hereditary risk for depression. Method Thirty healthy, never-depressed monozygotic (MZ) twins with a co-twin history of depression (high risk group: n = 13) or without co-twin history of depression (low-risk group: n = 17) were enrolled in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During fMRI, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. After the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping strategies. Results High-risk twins showed increased neural response to happy and fearful faces in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), pre-supplementary motor area and occipito-parietal regions compared to low-risk twins. They also displayed stronger negative coupling between amygdala and pregenual ACC, dmPFC and temporo-parietal regions during emotional face processing. These task-related changes in neural responses in high-risk twins were accompanied by impaired gender discrimination performance during face processing. They also displayed increased attention vigilance for fearful faces and were slower at recognizing facial expressions relative to low-risk controls. These effects occurred in the absence of differences between groups in mood, subjective state or coping. Conclusions Different neural response and functional connectivity within fronto-limbic and occipito-parietal regions during emotional face processing and enhanced fear vigilance may be key endophenotypes for depression.

Moreover, threat avoidance compared to vigilance predicts a poorer outcome from exposure-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), yet the mechanisms underlying this differential response are unclear. Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely accepted theory to explain the acquisition and extinction of fear, including exposure-based treatments, such as CBT. In typical fear conditioning experiments, anxious children have shown larger physiological responses to an aversive unconditional stimulus (i.e., US on CS+ trials) and to non-reinforced stimuli (CS-) during fear acquisition and to both CSs during fear extinction compared to non-anxious peers. This study examined whether threat avoidance compared to threat vigilance was related to differences in fear acquisition and extinction in anxious children. Thirty-four clinically-anxious children completed a visual probe task including angry-neutral face pairs to determine the direction of threat attention bias as well as a discriminant conditioning and extinction task in which a geometric shape CS+ was paired with an aversive tone US, while the CS- geometric shape was always presented alone during acquisition trials. Both CSs were presented alone during extinction trials. Fear acquisition and extinction were indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR) and subjective measures. Children were classified as threat vigilant (N=18) and threat avoidant (n=16) based on the direction of threat attention bias on the visual probe task. During acquisition, threat avoidant relative to threat vigilant anxious children displayed larger orienting SCRs to both CSs during the first block of trials and larger third interval SCRs to the US on CS+ trials as well as on CS- trials. During extinction, threat avoidant anxious children showed delayed extinction of SCRs to both the CS+ and CS- and reported higher subjective anxiety ratings after extinction compared to threat vigilant anxious children. Threat avoidant anxious children may be more reactive physiologically to novel cues and to stimuli that become associated with threat and this may interfere with extinction learning. These findings could help explain previous evidence that threat avoidant anxious children do not respond as well as threat vigilant anxious children to exposure-based CBT. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety disorders; Attention bias; Children; Conditioning; Extinction","anxiety; Article; association; attentional bias; aversion; child; child behavior; clinical article; controlled study; electrodermal response; fear; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; learning; male; perceptive discrimination; phobia; reinforcement; separation anxiety; social phobia; task performance; threat; visual stimulation; anxiety; attention; fear; physiology; psychology; reinforcement; Anxiety; Attention; Child; Extinction, Psychological; Fear; Female; Galvanic Skin Response; Humans; Male","DP1095536, ARC, Australian Research Council","This research was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council (Grant DP1095536 ) awarded to Dr Allison Waters.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919935086

However, the mechanisms through which fluoxetine influences symptoms in youth have been little investigated. This study examined whether acute administration of fluoxetine in a sample of young healthy adults altered the processing of affective information, including positive, sad and anger cues. Method A total of 35 male and female volunteers aged between 18 and 21 years old were randomized to receive a single 20 mg dose of fluoxetine or placebo. At 6 h after administration, participants completed a facial expression recognition task, an emotion-potentiated startle task, an attentional dot-probe task and the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Subjective ratings of mood, anxiety and side effects were also taken pre- and post-fluoxetine/placebo administration. Results Relative to placebo-treated participants, participants receiving fluoxetine were less accurate at identifying anger and sadness and did not show the emotion-potentiated startle effect. There were no overall significant effects of fluoxetine on subjective ratings of mood. Conclusions Fluoxetine can modulate emotional processing after a single dose in young adults.

The current study examined visual attention biases in 8-year-old children who were part of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP). Relations among attention biases and concurrent social outcomes were also investigated. In early childhood, 136 children abandoned at birth or shortly thereafter into institutional care were randomized to receive a high-quality foster care intervention or care-as-usual within the context of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP). At 8 years of age, 50 care-as-usual, 55 foster care, and 52 community controls performed a behavioral dot-probe task, and indices of attention biases to threat and positive stimuli were calculated. Concurrent data on social behavior were collected. Children placed into the foster care intervention had a significant attention bias toward positive stimuli, while children who received care-as-usual had a significant bias toward threat. Children in the foster care intervention had a significantly larger positive bias when compared to the care-as-usual group. A positive bias was related to more social engagement, more prosocial behavior, less externalizing disorders, and less emotionally withdrawn behavior. The magnitude of positive bias was predicted by age of placement into foster care among children with a history of institutionalization. An attention bias towards positive stimuli was associated with reduced risk for behavioral problems amongst children who experienced early psychosocial deprivation. Research assessing attention biases in children experiencing early environmental stress may refine our understanding of the mechanisms underlying risk for later psychiatric and social disorders and inform prevention efforts. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"analysis of variance; attention; child; child development; controlled study; early childhood intervention; emotion; female; follow up; foster care; human; institutionalized child; male; Mental Disorders; peer pressure; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; Romania; social isolation; statistical bias; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Child; Child Development; Child, Institutionalized; Early Intervention (Education); Emotions; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foster Home Care; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Peer Influence; Psychosocial Deprivation; Romania; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938062666

In five experiments, observers performed an object categorization task involving drawings of fish (Experiments 1–4) and photographs of natural sea animals (Experiment 5). Allocation of attention to distinguishing and non-distinguishing features was examined using primed-matching (Experiment 1) and visual probe (Experiments 2, 4, 5) methods, and manipulated by spatial precuing (Experiment 3). Converging results indicated that in performing the object categorization task, attention was allocated to the distinguishing features in a context-dependent manner, and that such allocation facilitated performance. Based on the view that object recognition, like categorization, is essentially a process of discrimination between probable alternatives, the implications of the findings for the role of attention to distinguishing features in object recognition are discussed. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Distinguishing features; Object categorization; Object recognition; Visual attention","Article; attention; classification; drawing; human; human experiment; novel object recognition test; photography; priority journal; task performance; visual information; accuracy; mental task; normal human; object categorization task; object recognition; recognition; response time","University of Haifa; 1110/10; 31905; ISF, Israel Science Foundation","Please address all correspondence to Orit Baruch, Department of Psychology and Institute of Information Processing and Decision Making, University of Haifa, Haifa 31905, Israel.

Having a heightened awareness of these visual food cues may impact on food choices and eating behaviours with those being most aware of or demonstrating greater attention to food-related stimuli potentially being at greater risk of overeating and subsequent weight gain. To date, research related to attentional responses to visual food cues has been both limited and conflicting. Such inconsistent findings may in part be explained by the use of different methodological approaches to measure attentional bias and the impact of other factors such as hunger levels, energy density of visual food cues and individual eating style traits that may influence visual attention to food-related cues outside of weight status alone. This review examines the various methodologies employed to measure attentional bias with a particular focus on the role that attentional processing of food-related visual cues may have in obesity. Based on the findings of this review, it appears that it may be too early to clarify the role visual attention to food-related cues may have in obesity. Results however highlight the importance of considering the most appropriate methodology to use when measuring attentional bias and the characteristics of the study populations targeted while interpreting results to date and in designing future studies. © 2014 The Authors.","Eye tracking; Incentive sensitisation; Stroop; Visual probe; Weight status","Article; association; attentional bias; body weight; caloric intake; eye tracking; feeding behavior; human; hunger; obesity; overnutrition; response time; risk factor; satiety; sensitization; stimulus response; Stroop test; task performance; visual stimulation; weight gain; attention; cues; Feeding Behavior; Food; Humans; Hunger; Hyperphagia; Motivation; Obesity; Photic Stimulation; physiology; psychology; Reward; Attention; Cues; Feeding Behavior; Food; Humans; Hunger; Hyperphagia; Motivation; Obesity; Photic Stimulation; Reward",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921450097

In addition, this study investigated the potential moderating role of executive control (EC), and tested whether the relationship between alcohol-related attentional bias and alcohol use was especially present in young adolescents with weak EC. Participants were 86 adolescents (mean age. =. 14.86), who completed a Visual Probe Task (VPT) as an index of attentional bias, a flanker-task based Attention Network Task (ANT) as an index of EC, the sensitivity of punishment and sensitivity of reward questionnaire (SPSRQ) as an index of reward sensitivity, and an alcohol use questionnaire. High reward sensitivity, high alcohol-related attentional bias, and weak EC were all related to alcohol use. The relationship between reward sensitivity and alcohol use was not mediated by alcohol-related attentional bias. As hypothesized, attentional bias was only associated with alcohol use in participants with weak EC. Together, the present findings are consistent with the view that high reward sensitivity and low EC may be considered as risk factors for adolescent alcohol use. The independent contribution of reward sensitivity and attentional bias might suggest that adolescents who are highly reward sensitive and display an attentional bias for alcohol cues are at even higher risk for excessive alcohol use and developing alcohol abuse problems. Future research using a longitudinal approach would allow an examination of these risk factors on subsequent alcohol use.

The extent of emotional variability experienced during exposure therapy has also been found to predict better treatment outcomes in anxious adults. The present study examined whether pretreatment attention bias towards threat stimuli and greater emotional variability during exposure activities were associated with stronger treatment outcomes in anxious children receiving group-based cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: Twenty-six anxious children completed a visual probe task with emotional faces, followed by a 10-week CBT program in a group format. Children completed weekly within-session exposure activities during the last 5 weeks of group CBT. Results: Pretreatment attention bias towards threat stimuli, greater emotional variability and within-session habituation during exposure activities were significantly associated with reductions in clinicianand/ or parent-rated anxiety symptoms after the 10-week CBT program. Treatment responders had significantly higher peak emotional distress ratings during exposure activities. However, threat attention bias and within-session exposure measures were not significantly related. Conclusions: Pre-existing individual differences in attention bias to threat cues and the degree of emotional reactivity experienced during exposure activities are both important independent predictors of treatment outcomes for anxious children receiving group-based CBT. © The Author(s) 2015.","Anxiety; Attention bias; Children; Cognitive behavioural therapy; Emotional variability","anxiety disorder; Article; attentional bias; child; clinical article; cognitive therapy; controlled study; emotional stress; emotionality; exposure; facial expression; female; group therapy; habituation; human; male; outcome assessment; parent; physician; school child; stimulus response; therapy effect; threat; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937884424

Biases may also exist in individuals who recently experienced an episode of acute clinical pain, although limited investigation has been conducted. The present study is the first to explore attentional biases in women who experienced recent menstrual pain. Methods Seventy healthy women were recruited who experienced a regular menstrual cycle and a recent painful period. All participants completed a visual-probe task with pain-related and period-related symptom words, which were presented at subliminal (14 ms, followed by nonsensical consonant letter string for 286 ms) and supraliminal (300 ms, 1250 ms) exposure durations. Participants then completed a series of self-report measures, including a measure of cyclical perimenstrual symptoms. Results Recent menstrual pain severity was found to be significantly predictive of attentional bias towards pain-related words presented for 1250 ms. However, no significant evidence of bias was found towards period-related symptom words. Conclusions Pain-related attentional biases are associated with recent menstrual pain severity. The experience and severity of pain, rather than its duration (i.e., whether pain is chronic or acute), may be the primary determinants of pain-related attentional bias.

In order to prime their approach or avoidance motivational orientations, participants watched brief videos, the content of which (positive or negative depictions of alcohol, or neutral) varied by experimental group. Immediately after watching the videos, participants completed self-report (Approach and Avoidance of Alcohol Questionnaire; all studies) and implicit (visual probe task in study 1, stimulus-response compatibility task in studies 2 and 3) measures of alcohol-related approach and avoidance. In study 3, we incorporated an additional experimental manipulation of thought suppression in an attempt to maximize the influence of the videos on implicit measures. Findings were consistent across all three studies: increases in self-reported approach inclinations were mirrored by decreases in avoidance inclinations, and vice versa. However, a combined analysis of data from all studies demonstrated that changes in approach inclinations were partially independent of changes in avoidance inclinations. There were no effects on implicit alcohol-related processing biases, although methodological issues may partially account for these findings.

However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine on affect regulation have not been reliably demonstrated in human laboratory studies. We investigated the effects of nicotine abstinence (Experiment 1), and nicotine challenge and expectancy (Experiment 2) on attentional bias towards facial emotional stimuli differing in emotional valence. Methods: In Experiment 1, 46 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to either continue to abstain from smoking or to smoke immediately before testing. In Experiment 2, 96 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to smoke a nicotinized or denicotinized cigarette and to be told that the cigarette did or did not contain nicotine. In both experiments participants completed a visual probe task, where positively valenced (happy) and negatively valenced (sad) facial expressions were presented, together with neutral facial expressions. Results: In Experiment 1, there was evidence of an interaction between probe location and abstinence on reaction time, indicating that abstinent smokers showed an attentional bias for neutral stimuli. In Experiment 2, there was evidence of an interaction between probe location, nicotine challenge and expectation on reaction time, indicating that smokers receiving nicotine, but told that they did not receive nicotine, showed an attentional bias for emotional stimuli. Conclusions: Our data suggest that nicotine abstinence appears to disrupt attentional bias towards emotional facial stimuli. These data provide support for nicotine's modulation of attentional bias as a central mechanism for maintaining affect regulation in cigarette smoking. © The Author 2014.

Impulsivity may thus confer a vulnerability to weight gain by virtue of over-responsiveness to rewarding appetitive cues. This vulnerability should be detectable as heightened cognitive and behavioural responsiveness to food cues, namely, an attentional bias to food-stimuli, subjective wanting, and loss of inhibitory control. We examined this proposition by measuring reactions to acute, in-vivo, food-cue exposure in low-impulsive and high-impulsive individuals. We expected that high-impulsive individuals would: (1) show a greater attentional bias towards pictorial food cues presented after in-vivo food cue exposure; (2) show a greater appetitive reaction to high-calorie snack foods; and (3) show poorer inhibitory control after in vivo exposure compared to control. Fifty female participants (25 yr ± 1.1; 24 kg/m2 ± 0.6) randomly allocated to either a high-calorie food-cue exposure or food-neutral control condition subsequently completed a food-cue visual probe reaction time task, subjective ratings of appetitive state and the Stop-Signal task. A significant Group-by-Duration interaction indicated that high-impulsives show slowed disengagement (longer RTs for 2000 ms duration) of pictorial food stimuli compared to their low-impulsive counterparts. Conversely, the low impulsive group show greater attentional bias than the high impulsive group (faster RTs) at the 500 ms duration, indicating speeded detection of pictorial food cues. High-impulsives showed poorer response inhibition compared to low-impulsives following in-vivo food-cue exposure. Impulsivity did not significantly moderate the effect of in-vivo cue-exposure on desire-to-eat ratings. The evidence we obtained regarding inhibitory control following in vivo food cue exposure suggests that high-impulsive individuals may be prone to overeat when their reward systems are activated, a hypothesis that requires further confirmation. © 2015.","Attentional bias; Cue-reactivity; Impulsivity; Obesity","adult; appetite; Article; attentional bias; controlled study; experimental behavioral test; fast food; female; human; impulsiveness; in vivo study; inhibition (psychology); male; neurobiology; pictorial food cue; response time; stimulus response; association; attention; feeding behavior; food; inhibition (psychology); photostimulation; procedures; psychology; reaction time; reward; vision; weight gain; young adult; Adult; Appetite; Attention; Cues; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Reward; Visual Perception; Weight Gain; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926480471

Mothers and children completed a visual probe task with emotional face pairs presented for 500 ms.Results Attention bias in children did not significantly differ solely as a function of whether or not their mothers had lifetime emotional disorders. However, attention bias in high-risk children was significantly related to their mothers' attention bias. Specifically, children of mothers with lifetime emotional disorders showed a greater negative attention bias if their mothers had a greater tendency to direct attention away from positive information.Limitations This study was cross-sectional in nature, and therefore unable to assess long-term predictive effects. Also, just one exposure duration of 500 ms was utilised.Conclusion Attention bias for negative information is greater in offspring of mothers who have lifetime emotional disorders and a reduced positive bias, which could be a risk marker for the development of emotional disorders in children. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Background: Social and emotional factors are implicated as causal and maintaining factors in EDs. Difficulties in emotional regulation have been mainly studied in relation to adult interactions, with less interest given to interactions with infants. Method: A sample of 138 women were recruited, of which 49 suffered from Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 16 from Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and 73 were healthy controls (HCs). Attentional responses to happy and sad infant faces were tested with the visual probe detection task. Emotional identification of, and reactivity to, infant displays were measured using self-report measures. Facial expressions to video clips depicting sad, happy and frustrated infants were also recorded. Results: No significant differences between groups were observed in the attentional response to infant photographs. However, there was a trend for patients to disengage from happy faces. People with EDs also reported lower positive ratings of happy infant displays and greater subjective negative reactions to sad infants. Finally, patients showed a significantly lower production of facial expressions, especially in response to the happy infant video clip. Insecure attachment was negatively correlated with positive facial expressions displayed in response to the happy infant and positively correlated with the intensity of negative emotions experienced in response to the sad infant video clip. Conclusion: People with EDs do not have marked abnormalities in their attentional processing of infant emotional faces. However, they do have a reduction in facial affect particularly in response to happy infants. Also, they report greater negative reactions to sadness, and rate positive emotions less intensively than HCs.

As individuals with PTSD possess an attentional bias towards threat-relevant information ABM may prove effective in reducing PTSD symptoms. We examined the efficacy of ABM as an adjunct treatment for PTSD in a real-world setting. We administered ABM in conjunction with prolonged exposure or cognitive-processing therapy and medication in a community inpatient treatment facility for military personnel diagnosed with PTSD. Participants were randomized to either ABM or an attention control condition (ACC). While all participants experienced reductions in PTSD symptoms, participants in the ABM group experienced significantly fewer PTSD and depressive symptoms at post-treatment when compared to the ACC group. Moreover, change in plasticity of attentional bias mediated this change in symptoms and initial attentional bias moderated the effects of the treatment. These results suggest that ABM may be an effective adjunct treatment for PTSD. © 2014.","Attention training; Cognitive bias modification; PTSD","adult; Article; attention bias modification; attentional bias; clinical article; cognitive therapy; community hospital; controlled study; depression; female; hospital patient; human; male; nerve cell plasticity; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychopharmacotherapy; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; soldier; attention; middle aged; procedures; psychology; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","R34 MH073004-01, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R01 MH087623-04, NIH, National Institutes of Health","This project was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 MH087623-04 and R34 MH073004-01 awarded to Dr. Amir.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907813939

In the present study, we examined effects of a gamified ABMT mobile application in highly trait-anxious participants (N = 78). A single session of the active training relative to the placebo training reduced subjective anxiety and observed stress reactivity.

It was expected that participants would demonstrate greater biases to pictures over words, and to high-calorie over low-calorie foods. A secondary aim was to examine associations between BMI, dietary restraint, external eating and attentional biases. It was expected that high scores on these individual difference variables would be associated with a bias towards high-calorie stimuli. Methods: Undergraduates (N = 99) completed a dot probe task including matched word and pictorial food stimuli in a controlled setting. Questionnaires assessing eating behaviour were administered, and height and weight were measured. Results: Contrary to predictions, there were no main effects for stimuli type (pictures vs words) or calorific value (high vs low). There was, however, a significant interaction effect suggesting a bias towards high-calorie pictures, but away from high-calorie words; and a bias towards low-calorie words, but away from low-calorie pictures. No associations between attentional bias and any of the individual difference variables were found. Discussion: The presence of a stimulus type by calorific value interaction demonstrates the importance of stimuli type in the dot probe task, and may help to explain inconsistencies in prior research. Further research is needed to clarify associations between attentional bias and BMI, restraint, and external eating. © 2014.","Attentional bias; Cognition; Dot probe; Eating behaviour; Food; Stimuli","adult; Article; attentional bias; body height; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; calorie; diet restriction; eating; feeding behavior; female; food; human; male; questionnaire; adolescent; adverse effects; attention; Australia; comparative study; educational model; food; learning; nutritional value; patient education; pilot study; procedures; reproducibility; student; teaching; university; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Association Learning; Attention; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Energy Intake; Female; Food; Humans; Male; Models, Educational; New South Wales; Nutritive Value; Patient Education as Topic; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Students; Universities; Verbal Learning; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907507580

Some research suggests that depressive symptoms decrease once this bias is “corrected”. Thus, attention may play a causal and/or sustaining role in depression. The present study examined whether (a) attention can be modified in a student sample to induce a negative attentional bias; and (b) this trained attentional bias will be associated with negative shifts in mood and cognitions. A sample of undergraduates (N = 112) were recruited and asked to complete questionnaires designed to measure depressive symptoms, mood, and negative thoughts toward the self. Participants were then randomly assigned to either an attend-negative (n = 60) or a no-training control condition (n = 52), and asked to complete a computer task. In the attend-negative condition, the computer task (dot probe) was designed to elicit a transient attentional bias toward negative stimuli. After the completion of this task, participants completed the questionnaires a second time. Participants in the experimental condition evidenced higher negative attentional bias scores in comparison to control participants. Further, females demonstrated more negative attention at the end of the training relative to males. Repeated measures analysis of variances further found that following the completion of the computer task, both groups evidenced a negative shift in mood. These results must be interpreted with caution given that baseline attentional biases were not measured in this study.

China has a large number of children and adolescents, who tend to be most vulnerable because they are in an early stage of human development and possible post-traumatic psychological distress may have a life-long consequence. Trauma survivors without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have received little attention in previous studies, especially in event-related potential (ERP) studies. We compared the attention bias to threat stimuli between the earthquake-exposed group and the control group in a masked version of the dot probe task. The target probe presented at the same space location consistent with earthquake-related words was the congruent trial, while in the space location of neutral words was the incongruent trial. Thirteen earthquake-exposed middle school students without PTSD and 13 matched controls were included in this investigation. The earthquake-exposed group showed significantly faster RTs to congruent trials than to incongruent trials. The earthquake-exposed group produced significantly shorter C1 and P1 latencies and larger C1, P1 and P2 amplitudes than the control group. In particular, enhanced P1 amplitude to threat stimuli was observed in the earthquake-exposed group. These findings are in agreement with the prediction that earthquake-exposed survivors have an attention bias to threat stimuli. The traumatic event had a much greater effect on earthquake-exposed survivors even if they showed no PTSD symptoms than individuals in the controls.

Attention training towards positive stimuli (ATP) and OST (ATP+OST) was expected to have more positive effects on implicit and explicit cognitive mechanisms and clinical outcome measures than an attention training control (ATC) condition plus OST (ATC+OST). Thirty-seven children (6-17 years) with a specific phobia were randomly assigned to ATP+OST or ATC+OST. In ATP+OST, children completed 160 trials of attention training responding to a probe that always followed the happy face in happy-angry face pairs. In ATC+OST, the probe appeared equally often after angry and happy faces. In the same session, children completed OST targeting their phobic situation/object. Clinical outcomes included clinician, parent and child report measures. Cognitive outcomes were assessed in terms of change in attention bias to happy and angry faces and in danger and coping expectancies. Assessments were completed before and after treatment and three-months later. Compared to ATC+OST, the ATP+OST condition produced (a) significantly greater reductions in children's danger expectancies about their feared situations/object during the OST and at three-month follow-up, and (b) significantly improved attention bias towards positive stimuli at post-treatment, which in turn, predicted a lower level of clinician-rated phobia diagnostic severity three-months after treatment. There were no significant differences between ATP+OST and ATC+OST conditions in clinician, parent, or child-rated clinical outcomes. Training children with phobias to focus on positive stimuli is effective in increasing attention towards positive stimuli and reducing danger expectancy biases. Studies with larger sample sizes and a stronger 'dose' of ATP prior to the OST may reveal promising outcomes on clinical measures for training attention towards positive stimuli. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention training; Children; Exposure therapy; Phobias","adolescent; age distribution; Article; attentional bias; attentional bias modification training towards positive stimuli; child; child care; child parent relation; cognitive therapy; controlled study; coping behavior; disease severity; DSM-IV; executive function; facial expression; female; follow up; Global Assessment of Functioning; human; major clinical study; male; neuropsychological test; one session treatment; outcome assessment; phobia; photography; preschool child; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; response time; school child; separation anxiety; Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire; social phobia; specific phobia; Spence Children Anxiety Scale; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stimulus response; task performance; treatment duration; treatment response; visual stimulation; attention; behavior therapy; cognitive therapy; emotion; Phobic Disorders; physiology; procedures; psychology; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Attention; Child; Cognitive Therapy; Emotions; Female; Humans; Implosive Therapy; Male; Phobic Disorders; Treatment Outcome",,"This research was supported by a Griffith University Areas of Strategic Investment in Chronic Disease Prevention Grant awarded to the authors.

Efforts have sought to identify specific factors underlying DUI recidivism. Of particular interest is the role that alcohol-related cognitions might play in the development and escalation of alcohol use. The present study investigated the degree to which preoccupation with, and attentional bias to, alcohol are heightened among repeat DUI offenders.Method: Three groups of participants (recidivist DUI offenders, first-time offenders, and controls; n = 20 per group) performed a visual probe task to measure attentional bias and completed questionnaires regarding their cognitive and emotional preoccupation with alcohol and drinking habits.Results: Recidivist offenders displayed a significantly heightened alcohol attentional bias and reported greater preoccupation with alcohol compared with both first-time offenders and controls. By contrast, none of the groups differed with regard to the self-reported quantity and frequency of their consumption.Conclusions: Factors reflecting preoccupation with alcohol have utility for differentiating recidivist offenders from both first-time offenders and nonoffenders.

It has been proposed as an efficient, accessible psychological therapy and is based on cognitive theories of attention. The present review sought to investigate the efficacy of ABM as a potential treatment for child and adolescent anxiety. Method A systematic literature review was conducted, using three main databases, PsycINFO, Embase and Medline, to identify original research articles which measured the effect of ABM on anxiety levels in children and/or adolescents. Results Ten articles met the inclusion criteria and of these 10, three were randomised control trials. A lack of standardisation in relation to the treatment protocol was observed; nonetheless the identified studies generally provided evidence for the efficacy of ABM as an anxiety treatment. Limitations Due to the nature of the studies found, a statistical meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions ABM seems to be a promising, novel treatment for child and/or adolescent anxiety disorders with merits over lengthier, talking based therapies.

It has previously been suggested that addictions may operate through a mechanism of attentional bias, in which stimuli representative of the dependent substance increase in salience, thus increasing the addictive behavior. However, this hypothesis has not been tested for the case of snus. The current experiment used a modified Stroop task and a dotprobe task to investigate whether 40 snus users show an attentional bias towards snus-relevant stimuli, compared to 40 non-snus users. There were no significant differences between the two groups on reaction times or accuracy on either Stroop or dot-probe task, thus failing to show an attentional bias towards snus-relevant stimuli for snus users. This could imply that other mechanisms may contribute to maintenance of snus use than for other addictions.

In order to optimize such interventions, there needs to be better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of cognitive bias modification (CBM). Here we present a protocol for an investigation of the neural effects of CBM and varenicline in non-quitting daily smokers.Methods/Design: We will recruit 72 daily smokers who report smoking at least 10 manufactured cigarettes or 15 roll-ups per day and who smoke within one hour of waking. Participants will attend two sessions approximately one week apart. At the first session participants will be screened for eligibility and randomized to receive either varenicline or a placebo over a seven-day period. On the final drug-taking day (day seven) participants will attend a second session and be further randomized to one of three CBM conditions (training towards smoking cues, training away from smoking cues, or control training). Participants will then undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan during which they will view smoking-related pictorial cues. Primary outcome measures are changes in cognitive bias as measured by the visual dot-probe task, and neural responses to smoking-related cues. Secondary outcome measures will be cognitive bias as measured by a transfer task (modified Stroop test of smoking-related cognitive bias) and subjective mood and cigarette craving.Discussion: This study will add to the relatively small literature examining the effects of CBM in addictions. It will address novel questions regarding the neural effects of CBM. It will also investigate whether varenicline treatment alters neural response to smoking-related cues.

This asks for research investigating how and what kinds of goals shape emotional attention. The present study investigated how the goal to suppress a negative emotional state influences attention to emotion-congruent events. After inducing disgust, we instructed participants to suppress all feelings of disgust during a subsequent dot probe task. Attention to disgusting images was modulated by the sort of distracter that was presented in parallel with disgusting imagery. When disgusting images were presented together with neutral images, emotion suppression was accompanied by a tendency to attend to disgusting images. However, when disgusting images were shown with positive images that allow coping with disgust (i.e., images representing cleanliness), attention tended away from disgusting images and toward images representing cleanliness. These findings show that emotion suppression influences the allocation of attention but that the successful avoidance of emotion-congruent events depends on the availability of effective distracters.

However, little is known about the neurobiology of this endophenotype and no known in vivo molecular imaging study has been conducted to evaluate candidate receptor systems that may be implicated in this endophenotype or the phenotypic expression of trauma-related psychopathology that comprises threat (ie, re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) and loss (ie, emotional numbing, depression/dysphoria, generalized anxiety) symptomatology. Using the radioligand [11C]OMAR and positron emission tomography (PET), we evaluated the relationship between in vivo cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor availability in the amygdala, and performance on a dot-probe measure of attentional bias to threat, and clinician interview-based measures of trauma-related psychopathology. The sample comprised adults presenting with a broad spectrum of trauma-related psychopathology, ranging from nontrauma-exposed, psychiatrically healthy adults to trauma-exposed adults with severe trauma-related psychopathology. Results revealed that increased CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala was associated with increased attentional bias to threat, as well as increased severity of threat, but not loss, symptomatology; greater peripheral anandamide levels were associated with decreased attentional bias to threat. A mediation analysis further suggested that attentional bias to threat mediated the relationship between CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala and severity of threat symptomatology. These data substantiate a key role for compromised endocannabinoid function in mediating both the endophenotypic and phenotypic expression of threat symptomatology in humans. They further suggest that novel pharmacotherapies that target the CB1 system may provide a more focused, mechanism-based approach to mitigating this core aspect of trauma-related psychopathology. © 2014 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",,"amide; anandamide; arachidonic acid derivative; cannabinoid 1 receptor; carbon; endocannabinoid; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; amygdaloid nucleus; attention; blood; fear; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; positron emission tomography; psychologic test; scintiscanning; young adult; Adult; Amygdala; Arachidonic Acids; Attention; Carbon Radioisotopes; Endocannabinoids; Fear; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Polyunsaturated Alkamides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Young Adult","Yale Cancer Center; NIH, National Institutes of Health; NCATS, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; RO1MH102566, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R21MH096105, NIH, National Institutes of Health; RO1MH096876, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R21MH085627, NIH, National Institutes of Health; NCRR, NCRR, National Center for Research Resources; Eli Lilly and Company; NCATS, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; UL1 RR024139","We acknowledge the excellent work of the staff of the Yale PET Center and the nursing support from Brenda Breault, Cynthia D’Amico, Michelle San Pedro, Jamie Cyr, and Deborah Campbell for their contributions with patient care during the PET scans.

All pictures (neutral, erotic) were rated on the dimensions of valence, arousal, disgust, and sexual arousal. Additionally, questionnaires measuring sexual interest/desire/motivation were employed. The ratings of the sexual stimuli point to a successful picture selection because sexual arousal did not differ between the sexes. The stimuli were equally arousing for men and women. Higher scores in the employed questionnaires measuring sexual interest/desire/motivation led to higher sexual arousal ratings of the sex pictures. Attentional bias towards sex pictures was observed in both experimental tasks. The attentional biases measured by the dot-probe and the lineorientation task were moderately intercorrelated suggesting attentional bias as a possible marker for a sex-attention trait. Finally, only the sexual sensation seeking score correlated with the attentional biases of the two tasks.

Eye-tracking data were analyzed by mixed-design analysis of variance with group (chronic pain versus pain-free) as the between-subjects factor, and word type (sensory pain versus neutral) as the within-subjects factor. Results showed a significant main effect for word type: all participants attended to pain-related words more than neutral words on several eye-tracking parameters. The group main effect was significant for number of fixations, which was greater in the chronic pain group. Finally, the group by word type interaction effect was significant for average visit duration, number of fixations, and total late-phase duration, all greater for sensory pain versus neutral words in the chronic pain group. As well, participants with chronic pain fixated significantly more frequently on pain words than did pain-free participants. In contrast, none of the effects for reaction time were significant.

Having a heightened awareness of these visual food cues may impact on food choices and eating behaviours with those being most aware of or demonstrating greater attention to food-related stimuli potentially being at greater risk of overeating and subsequent weight gain. To date, research related to attentional responses to visual food cues has been both limited and conflicting. Such inconsistent findings may in part be explained by the use of different methodological approaches to measure attentional bias and the impact of other factors such as hunger levels, energy density of visual food cues and individual eating style traits that may influence visual attention to food-related cues outside of weight status alone. This review examines the various methodologies employed to measure attentional bias with a particular focus on the role that attentional processing of food-related visual cues may have in obesity. Based on the findings of this review, it appears that it may be too early to clarify the role visual attention to food-related cues may have in obesity.

Patients with painful disorders are reported to show attentional biases toward pain-related information. However, these findings are controversial and rarely has any study examined whether chronic pain patients have attentional biases to pain-related conditioned stimuli (CS). In this study, 21 patients diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) were recruited from the neurosurgical department of a large urban general hospital. Sixteen family members and 21 pain-free volunteers were included as two separate control groups. Pain ratings, pain-related anxiety, general anxiety, and depression were measured in all subjects using questionnaires. Two dot probe tests were performed, one which used pictures of painful versus neutral faces as cues, and another that presented three types of CS as cues that predicted certain, uncertain, or no pain. Our results demonstrated that the TN patients showed attentional biases towards painful faces and the CSs that signaled uncertain pain. Moreover, the ratings of negative emotion about their pain conditions correlated significantly with the presence of attentional biases. The patients' close family members, however, displayed biases towards uncertain-pain CS. This study demonstrates that patients with chronic pain have increased attention towards pain-related information and that the fearful thinking about pain was positively correlated with this phenomenon. © 2014 Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Attentional bias; Chronic pain; Dot probe task; Pain signal",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937849424

CSB has been conceptualized as either an impulse control disorder or a non-substance 'behavioural' addiction. Substance use disorders are commonly associated with attentional biases to drug cues which are believed to reflect processes of incentive salience. Here we assess male CSB subjects compared to age-matched male healthy controls using a dot probe task to assess attentional bias to sexually explicit cues. We show that compared to healthy volunteers, CSB subjects have enhanced attentional bias to explicit cues but not neutral cues particularly for early stimuli latency. Our findings suggest enhanced attentional bias to explicit cues possibly related to an early orienting attentional response. This finding dovetails with our recent observation that sexually explicit videos were associated with greater activity in a neural network similar to that observed in drug-cue-reactivity studies. Greater desire or wanting rather than liking was further associated with activity in this neural network. These studies together provide support for an incentive motivation theory of addiction underlying the aberrant response towards sexual cues in CSB. © 2014 Mechelmans et al.",,"adult; article; attentional bias; clinical article; compulsive sexual behavior; controlled study; heterosexual male; human; male; obsessive compulsive disorder; pornography use; psychologic assessment; reaction time; sexual arousal; sexual behavior; stimulus response; task performance; association; compulsion; motivation; nerve cell network; photostimulation; psychology; sexual behavior; Adult; Compulsive Behavior; Cues; Humans; Male; Motivation; Nerve Net; Photic Stimulation; Sexual Behavior",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930195171

AB with respect to five categories of threat stimuli (i.e., angry faces, attacking dogs, attacking snakes, pointed weapons, violent scenes) was evaluated.

Three types of childhood events were assessed in 83 never-depressed and 337 formerly depressed individuals: trauma within the family, trauma outside the family, and adverse events. Furthermore, after a sad mood induction procedure, participants executed a Dot Probe task (selective attentional bias), an Emotional Stroop task (attentional interference bias) and an incidental learning task (memory bias). The association of these measures with case status and recurrence status (one or multiple past episodes) was examined. Negative memory bias and traumatic childhood events within the family were associated with case status, whereas none of the bias measures or childhood events variables were associated with recurrence status.

Meta-analyses now show that information-processing biases do characterize anxious individuals. More specifically, anxious individuals preferentially attend to threat-relevant information as well as interpreting ambiguous information as threatening. There is also some evidence that there is preferential memory for social information in socially anxious individuals. By far the majority of this research has examined the correlational nature of these cognitive biases and anxiety. However, since the second edition of this book, accumulating evidence suggests that such biases may play a causal role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorders. In previous editions, we introduced the concept of experimental approaches to modifying information-processing biases and presented preliminary evidence suggesting the utility of these interventions. Since the last edition of this chapter, the field has witnessed a surge of interest in the modification of cognitive biases in social anxiety. This research has largely focused on attentional bias modification, although research is beginning to accumulate examining the efficacy of interpretation bias modification in reducing social anxiety symptoms. Together these studies suggest that information-processing biases may be causally implicated in social anxiety. Relative to attention and interpretation, research on memory biases in social anxiety lags behind. In this chapter, we summarize the evidence for information-processing biases that may characterize socially anxious individuals.

This review aimed to evaluate whether internet-delivered psychological treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are efficacious, noninferior to established treatments, safe, and cost-effective for children, adolescents and adults. Methods: We searched the literature for studies published until March 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for the assessment of short-term efficacy and safety and were pooled in meta-analyses. Other designs were also considered for long-term effect and cost-effectiveness. Comparisons against established treatments were evaluated for noninferiority. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevant studies for risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was graded using an international grading system. Results: A total of 52 relevant RCTs were identified whereof 12 were excluded due to high risk of bias. Five costeffectiveness studies were identified and three were excluded due to high risk of bias. The included trials mainly evaluated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) against a waiting list in adult volunteers and 88% were conducted in Sweden or Australia. One trial involved children. For adults, the quality of evidence was graded as moderate for the short-term efficacy of I-CBT vs. waiting list for mild/moderate depression (d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.59, 1.07) and social phobia (d = 0.85; 95% CI 0.66, 1.05), and moderate for no efficacy of internet-delivered attention bias modification vs. sham treatment for social phobia (d = -0.04; 95% CI -0.24, 0.35). The quality of evidence was graded as low/very low for other disorders, interventions, children/adolescents, noninferiority, adverse events, and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: I-CBT is a viable treatment option for adults with depression and some anxiety disorders who request this treatment modality. Important questions remain before broad implementation can be supported. Future research would benefit from prioritizing adapting treatments to children/adolescents and using noninferiority designs with established forms of treatment. © 2014 Arnberg et al.",,"adverse outcome; anxiety disorder; Australia; cognitive therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; disease severity; health care delivery; hospital admission; human; Internet; meta analysis; mood disorder; onset age; outcomes research; patient safety; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; social phobia; Sweden; systematic review; treatment response; volunteer; adolescent; adult; Anxiety Disorders; child; cognitive therapy; cost benefit analysis; economics; Mood Disorders; preschool child; procedures; psychotherapy; publishing; time; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Child; Child, Preschool; Cognitive Therapy; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Internet; Mood Disorders; Psychotherapy; Publication Bias; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901295625

Methodology/Principal findings: The experiment was conducted in a courtroom with participants seated in the jury box. Participants first watched a video of a federal judge reading jury instructions that contained presumption of innocence instructions, or matched length alternative instructions. Immediately following this video a dot-probe task was administered to assess the priming effect of the jury instructions. Presumption of innocence instructions, but not the alternative instructions, led to significantly faster response times to Black faces when compared with White faces.

Oxytocin is a neuromodulatory hormone involved in social emotional processing associated with attentional processes. This study aimed to examine the impact of oxytocin on attentional processes to social faces representing anger, disgust, and happiness in patients with anorexia nervosa. Method: A double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design was used. Intranasal oxytocin or placebo followed by a visual probe detection task with faces depicting anger, disgust, and happiness was administered to 64 female subjects: 31 patients with anorexia nervosa and 33 control students. Results: Attentional bias to the disgust stimuli was observed in both groups under the placebo condition. The attentional bias to disgust was reduced under the oxytocin condition (a moderate effect in the patient group). Avoidance of angry faces was observed in the patient group under the placebo condition and vigilance was observed in the healthy comparison group; both of these information processing responses were moderated by oxytocin producing an increase in vigilance in the patients. Happy/smiling faces did not elicit an attentional response in controls or the patients under either the placebo or oxytocin conditions. Conclusion: Oxytocin attenuated attentional vigilance to disgust in patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy controls. On the other hand, oxytocin changed the response to angry faces from avoidance to vigilance in patients but reduced vigilance to anger in healthy controls. We conclude that patients with anorexia nervosa appear to use different strategies/circuits to emotionally process anger from their healthy counterparts. © 2014 Kim et al.",,"oxytocin; placebo; adult; anger; anorexia nervosa; article; attention; attentional bias; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; disgust; double blind procedure; drug effect; emotion; female; happiness; human; social behavior; student; task performance; visual probe detection task; young adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897130579

We present evidence for the first time to our knowledge that the same logical argument applies in the food and eating domain. We conducted two experiments that used a modified dot probe paradigm to train undergraduate women to direct their attention toward (""attend"") or away from (""avoid"") food cues (i.e., pictures of chocolate). In Experiment 1, attentional bias for chocolate cues increased in the ""attend"" group, and decreased in the ""avoid"" group. Experiment 2 showed that these training effects generalized to novel, previously unseen chocolate pictures. Importantly, attentional retraining affected chocolate consumption and craving. In both experiments, participants in the ""avoid"" group ate less chocolate in a so-called taste test than did those in the ""attend"" group. In addition, in Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, the ""attend"" group reported stronger chocolate cravings following training, whereas the ""avoid"" group reported less intense cravings. The results support predictions of cognitive- motivational models of craving and consumption that attentional biases play a causal role in consumption behavior.

The purpose of this study was to examine threat-related AB in patients with ANand healthy control participants (HC) and the relationship between AB and eating disorder and other psychopathology. Method Forty-nine female outpatients with AN or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Anorexia Type (EDNOS-AN), and 44 female HC completed a dot-probe task with threat words and a range of self-report measures assessing eating disorder symptoms and other psychopathology. Results There was no evidence for a differential threat-related AB in AN patients despite elevated anxiety in this group. The AB-index, a parameter of the magnitude of attention allocation when two competing stimuli are presented, did not correlate with any of the self-report measures. However, patients with AN responded significantly more slowly to the probe as compared to controls, regardless of the valence or position of the stimuli.

Recent studies in healthy participants suggest that attentional control (AC) may facilitate inhibition of automatic attentional processes associated with anxiety.To investigate relationships among AC, trauma-related AB, symptom severity and trait anxiety in patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), participants (N=91) completed self-report measures of AC, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and trait anxiety. AB was measured with a pictorial version of the Dot Probe Test.AC moderated the relationship between PTSS and AB (threat avoidance). Patients high in PTSS and low in AC showed attentional avoidance. No association between PTSS and AB in patients with medium or high levels of AC was found. A similar pattern of results was observed for the relationship between trait anxiety, AC and AB. These results suggest that a low ability to control attention is a risk factor for AB in PTSD.

This attentional bias is clinically significant, as it may contribute to relapse. Thus, identifying neural and genetic correlates of attentional bias is critical for improving interventions. Our previous studies show that the dopamine transporter (DAT) SLC6A3 genotype exerts profound effects on limbic responses to SCs. One potential mechanism underlying these effects is greater attentional bias for SCs. Here, we explored associations between attentional bias for SCs and neural responses to SCs among 'sated' smokers genotyped for the SLC6A3 polymorphism. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging images were acquired during SC exposure in 35 smokers genotyped for the SLC6A3 variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism (n = 16, 9-repeats; n = 19, 10/10-repeats). Participants completed a visual dot-probe attentional bias task, which contained pictures of smoking and non-smoking pictures, to examine whether genetic variation in DAT influences attentional bias and to investigate relationships between attentional bias and neural responses to SCs. Although attentional bias to smoking pictures was not significantly different between 9-repeats and 10/10-repeats, 9-repeats showed a positive correlation between attentional bias and increased SC-induced brain activity in the amygdala, whereas 10/10-repeats showed an inverse correlation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). In group comparisons, 9-repeats exhibited positive correlations between attentional bias and SCs in the mOFC and amygdala, relative to 10/10-repeats. Findings suggest that genetic variation in the DAT gene influences brain responses associated with attentional bias; thus, providing additional support for a SC-vulnerable endophenotype. © Published 2012.

Mean reaction time to control images was shorter than to TIs, confirming the attentional avoidance of TIs. Attentional avoidance of TIs and the lower emotional valence of these stimuli may have been a strategy to avoid relapse.

Prior literature on possible locations of human prostate cancer from transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), however, is limited and has led to biased reconstructed DOT images. In this work, we propose a hierarchical clustering method (HCM) to improve the accuracy of image reconstruction with limited prior information. HCM reconstructs DOT images in three steps: 1) to reconstruct the human prostate, 2) to divide the prostate region into geometric clusters to search for anomalies in finer clusters, 3) to continue the geometric clustering within anomalies for improved reconstruction. We demonstrated this hierarchical clustering method using computer simulations and laboratory phantom experiments.

Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders. Method Diagnostic and attention bias data were analysed from 435 children between 5 and 13 years of age; 158 had principal fear disorder (specific phobia, social phobia or separation anxiety disorder), 75 had principal distress disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD) and 202 had no psychiatric disorder. Anxious children were a clinic-based treatment-seeking sample. Attention bias was assessed on a visual-probe task with angry, neutral and happy faces. Results Compared to healthy controls, children with principal distress disorder (GAD) showed a significant bias towards threat relative to neutral faces whereas children with principal fear disorder showed an attention bias away from threat relative to neutral faces. Overall, children displayed an attention bias towards happy faces, irrespective of diagnostic group. Conclusions Our findings support the distinction between fear and distress disorders, and extend empirically derived structural models of emotional disorders to threat processing in childhood, when many anxiety disorders begin and predict lifetime impairment. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.","Anxiety disorders; attention bias; children; distress disorders; fear disorders","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; anxiety disorder; article; attention; case control study; child; classification; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; facial expression; fear; female; human; male; mental stress; methodology; photostimulation; physiology; preschool child; psychologic test; psychological aspect; reaction time; self report; severity of illness index; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Stress, Psychological",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891792902

Surface functionalization of nanoparticles introduces an additional dimension in controlling nanoparticle interfacial properties and provides an effective bridge to connect nanoparticles to biological systems. With fascinating photoluminescence properties, carbon dots (C-dots), carbon-containing nanoparticles that are attracting considerable attention as a new type of quantum dot, are becoming both an important class of imaging probes and a versatile platform for engineering multifunctional nanosensors. In order to transfer C-dots from proof-of-concept studies toward real world applications such as in vivo bioimaging and biosensing, careful design and engineering of C-dot probes is becoming increasingly important.A comprehensive knowledge of how C-dot surfaces with various properties behave is essential for engineering C-dots with useful imaging properties such as high quantum yield, stability, and low toxicity, and with desirable biosensing properties such as high selectivity, sensitivity, and accuracy. Several reviews in recent years have reported preparation methods and properties of C-dots and described their application in biosensors, catalysis, photovoltatic cells, and more. However, no one has yet systematically summarized the surface engineering of C-dots, nor the use of C-dots as fluorescent nanosensors or probes for in vivo imaging in cells, tissues, and living organisms.In this Account, we discuss the major design principles and criteria for engineering the surface functionality of C-dots for biological applications. These criteria include brightness, long-term stability, and good biocompatibility. We review recent developments in designing C-dot surfaces with various functionalities for use as nanosensors or as fluorescent probes with fascinating analytical performance, and we emphasize applications in bioimaging and biosensing in live cells, tissues, and animals. In addition, we highlight our work on the design and synthesis of a C-dot ratiometric biosensor for intracellular Cu2+ detection, and a twophoton fluorescent probe for pH measurement in live cells and tissues.We conclude this Account by outlining future directions in engineering the functional surface of C-dots for a variety of in vivo imaging applications, including dots with combined targeting, imaging and therapeutic-delivery capabilities, or high-resolution multiplexed vascular imaging. With each application C-dots should open new horizons of multiplexed quantitative detection, high-resolution fluorescence imaging, and long-term, real-time monitoring of their target. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"carbon; nanoparticle; animal; article; chemistry; engineering; fluorescence imaging; genetic procedures; human; methodology; surface property; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Carbon; Engineering; Humans; Nanoparticles; Optical Imaging; Surface Properties",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887890055

Systematic low-level differences between image classes are a potential cause of low internal reliability of the probe task (Ataya et al., 2012). Moreover, it is unclear whether automatic attentional capture by low-level properties such as size and colour in the non-substance related image could reduce attentional bias to the alcohol-related cue. Here, alcohol-related attentional bias was assessed in moderate social drinkers by measuring reaction times to targets that replaced either an alcohol-related or a non-alcohol related (i.e., neutral) picture. All alcohol-related images were greyscale, and the neutral stimulus could be either greyscale ('control'), in colour ('colour'), or greyscale and 25% larger in size ('25% larger size'). We found attentional bias towards the alcohol-related stimuli in the control and 25% larger size conditions, but not in the colour condition. The magnitude of attentional bias was significantly reduced in the colour condition compared to the control and 25% larger size conditions. These findings indicate that salient low-level features in the non-substance related cue, in particular colour, can reduce the effect of alcohol-related content on the allocation of alcohol drinkers' attention. Further, the results highlight the need for image pairs in visual probe tasks to be closely matched on basic perceptual dimensions.",,,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892429594

Numerous studies with both clinical and non-clinical populations have now demonstrated that ABM can reduce emotional vulnerability. However, some recent studies have failed to achieve change in either selective attention or emotional vulnerability using ABM methodologies, including a recent randomised controlled trial by Carlbring et al. Some have sought to represent such absence of evidence as a sound basis not to further pursue ABM as an online intervention. While these findings obviously raise questions about the specific conditions under which ABM procedures will produce therapeutic benefits, we suggest that the failure of some studies to modify selective attention does not challenge the theoretical and empirical basis of ABM. The present paper seeks to put these ABM failures in perspective within the broader context of attentional bias modification research. In doing so it is apparent that the current findings and future prospects of ABM are in fact very promising, suggesting that more research in this area is warranted, not less. © 2014 Clarke et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","ABM; Attentional bias modification; CBM; Cognitive bias modification; Experimental psychopathology","attentional bias; cognitive bias; human; mental disease; note; selective attention; attention; cognitive therapy; emotion; female; standards; statistical bias; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Cognitive Therapy; Emotions; Female; Humans",,,Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892871581

AR trains addicts to attend away from drug-related cues, thereby reducing exposure to drug cues and reducing craving. We examined the utility of delivering AR to smokers on a personal digital assistant (PDA) in the natural environment. Method: Smokers (N = 60) not seeking to quit were randomly assigned to an AR group or a control group (i.e., a group with no training). They carried a PDA with them for one week. They were prompted to complete four assessments daily, including three attentional retrainings (AR group) or three control trainings (control group), and one evaluation of attentional bias. AR was implemented using a modified visual probe task. Attentional bias was assessed using a standard visual probe task on the PDA. Results: The AR group completed an average of 15.0 attentional retrainings and the control group completed an average of 14.9 control trainings. As hypothesized, attentional bias declined over the week in the AR group, but not in the control group, Group × Day interaction, F(1, 232) = 4.77, p = .03. AR also reduced craving ratings following a briefly presented picture containing smoking and nonsmoking features, group main effect, F(1, 234) = 3.89, p = .04.

We conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. All participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. Attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. Participants completed weekly Internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. The between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. On measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre-post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. Both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. Improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Attention training; Attentional bias; Cognitive bias modification; Mobile app treatment; Social anxiety","adult; aged; article; attention; attention bias modification; attentional bias; cognitive bias; controlled study; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; disgust; double blind procedure; effect size; facial expression; female; human; intention to treat analysis; Internet; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self Report Version; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mobile phone; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; outcome assessment; patient worry; Penn State Worry Questionnaire; protocol compliance; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; reliability; self report; Social Interaction Anxiety Scale; social phobia; young adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896488797

This randomized controlled trial examined the augmenting effects of threat-based ABMT on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in clinically anxious youth. Method: Sixty-three treatment-seeking children with anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: ABMT + CBT; ABMT placebo + CBT; and CBT-alone. Participants in the 2 ABMT conditions received repeated training on dot-probe tasks either designed to shift attention away from threats (active) or designed to induce no changes in attention patterns (placebo). Primary outcome measures were frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms as determined by a clinician using a semi-structured interview. Self- and parent-rated anxiety measures and threat-related attention bias scores were also measured before and after treatment. Results: Both the active and placebo ABMT groups showed greater reductions in clinician-rated anxiety symptoms than the CBT-alone group. Furthermore, only the active ABMT group showed significant reduction in self- or parent-rated anxiety symptoms. Finally, all groups showed a shift in attention patterns across the study, starting with a bias toward threat at baseline and shifting attention away from threat after treatment. Conclusions: Active and placebo ABMT might augment the clinical response to CBT for anxiety. This effect could arise from benefits associated with performing computer-based paradigms such as the dot-probe task. Given the absence of group differences in attention-bias changes during treatment, possible mechanisms and methodological issues underlying the observed findings are discussed.","anxiety; attention bias; attention bias modification treatment (ABMT); cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)","adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; article; attention; attention bias modification treatment; child; cognitive therapy; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; psychologic assessment; randomized controlled trial; school child; semi structured interview; treatment outcome; Anxiety Disorders; behavior therapy; cognitive therapy; physiology; procedures; Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Behavior Therapy; Child; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Treatment Outcome","ZIAMH002781, NIH, National Institutes of Health",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890540695

Attention Bias Modification (ABM) might be an interesting tool in the prevention of emotional disorders. The current study investigated whether visual search ABM might affect attentional bias and emotional functioning in adolescents. Methods A visual search task was used as a training paradigm; participants (n = 16 adolescents, aged 13-16) had to repeatedly identify the only smiling face in a 4 × 4 matrix of negative emotional faces, while participants in the control condition (n = 16) were randomly allocated to one of three placebo training versions. An assessment version of the task was developed to directly test whether attentional bias changed due to the training. Self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-esteem were measured pre- and post-training. Results After two sessions of training, the ABM group showed a significant decrease in attentional bias for negative information and self-reported social phobia, while the control group did not. There were no effects of training on depressive mood or self-esteem. Limitations No correlation between attentional bias and social phobia was found, which raises questions about the validity of the attentional bias assessment task. Also, the small sample size precludes strong conclusions. Conclusions Visual search ABM might be beneficial in changing attentional bias and social phobia in adolescents, but further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up is needed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In two studies, we tested in samples of healthy students whether a single session of ABM has an influence on early orienting of spatial attention as indexed by the N2pc. Replicating previous studies, we found an occipitotemporal N2pc (180-300ms) contralateral to angry versus neutral facial expressions, indicating that threatening faces automatically draw attention in early stages of stimulus processing. However, this N2pc effect did not significantly change during the ABM training session. Our results therefore indicate that a single session of ABM does not affect early attentional orienting.

Consistent with this idea, cognitive training techniques directly targeting such patterns of biased attention have been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety. Research seeking to establish the neurologic underpinnings of change in the attentional bias for threat have implicated, but not confirmed, the role of lateral prefrontal regions.Methods The current study sought to confirm experimentally the causal role of lateral prefrontal areas in the modification of attentional bias by delivering targeted cortical stimulation during attention bias modification training to assess the consequent effects on attentional bias change. While completing either an ""attend threat"" or ""avoid threat"" attention bias modification task, 77 volunteers (17-22 per group) received either active transcranial direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or a sham stimulation control condition.Results Participants receiving active stimulation showed greater evidence of attentional bias acquisition in the targeted direction (toward or away from threat) compared with participants in the sham stimulation condition.Conclusions Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that increasing activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex leads to greater evidence of attention bias modification. This evidence confirms the role of these areas in facilitating change in the allocation of attention to threat.

Objectives: This study provides an updated review of the clinical effect of ABM by employing standard meta-analytic procedures to (a) estimate the average effect size of ABM in reducing both attention bias (AB) and symptoms, (b) estimate the average effect size for different conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, and substance abuse), (c) test possible variables that may moderate the effect sizes, and (d) investigate the relationship between preexistent AB and the reduction in AB and symptoms. Method: We included 43 controlled trials with a total of 2,268 participants providing 47 group comparisons (i.e., training vs. control condition). Inclusion criteria were as follows: AB was specifically targeted to reduce symptomatology and emotional vulnerability; participants were randomized to the experimental conditions; a control condition (defined as sham training) existed; symptoms were assessed at least postintervention; sufficient data were provided to allow effect size estimation. Results: We obtained a small overall effect size on symptoms postintervention, g = 0.160, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.055, 0.265], driven by anxiety studies, g = 0.260, 95% CI = [0.132, 0.388], and studies conducted in healthy participants, g = 0.211, 95% CI = [0.046, 0.375]; no significant effect sizes were found postintervention for other symptom categories. Conclusion: The therapeutic benefit of ABM is rather small for anxiety, while the amount of data for other symptom categories is limited. We argue that more efficient, psychometrically sound procedures are needed for assessing and modifying AB. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Addictive behaviors; Anxiety; Attentional bias modification; Depression; Meta-analysis","Anxiety Disorders; attention; cognitive therapy; Depressive Disorder; human; Mental Disorders; meta analysis; procedures; psychometry; randomized controlled trial (topic); Substance-Related Disorders; treatment outcome; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Mental Disorders; Psychometrics; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Substance-Related Disorders; Treatment Outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917675272

Healthy adults with high social anxiety symptoms (n1/453) were randomized to receive either active or placebo ABM. Unlike placebo ABM, active ABM aimed to train individuals' attention away from threat. Using the dot-probe task, threat-related attention bias was measured during magnetic resonance imaging before and after acute and extended training over 4 weeks. A subset of participants completed all procedures (n1/430, 15 per group). Group differences in neural activation were identified using standard analyses. Linear regression tested predictive factors of symptom reduction (i.e., training group, baseline indices of threat bias). The active and placebo groups exhibited different patterns of right and left amygdala activation with training. Across all participants irrespective of group, individuals with greater left amygdala activation in the threat-bias contrast prior to training exhibited greater symptom reduction. After accounting for baseline amygdala activation, greater symptom reduction was associated with assignment to the active training group. Greater left amygdala activation at baseline predicted reductions in social anxiety symptoms following ABM.

The tendency to allocate attention to threat is well established in anxiety and other disorders of negative affect. SMD is characterized by the negative affect of irritability, and longitudinal studies suggest childhood irritability predicts adult anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is important to study pathophysiologic connections between irritability and anxiety disorders. Methods SMD patients (N = 74) and HC youth (N = 42) completed a visual probe paradigm to assess attention bias to emotional faces. Diagnostic interviews were conducted and measures of irritability and anxiety were obtained in patients. Results SMD youth differed from HC youth in having a bias toward threatening faces (P <.01). Threat bias was positively correlated with the severity of the SMD syndrome and depressive symptoms; degree of threat bias did not differ between SMD youth with and without co-occurring anxiety disorders or depression. SMD and HC youth did not differ in bias toward or away from happy faces. Conclusions SMD youth demonstrate an attention bias toward threat, with greater threat bias associated with higher levels of SMD symptom severity. Our findings suggest that irritability may share a pathophysiological link with anxiety and depressive disorders.

Objective, performance-based diagnostic markers that uniquely index risk for PTSD above and beyond subjective self-report markers could inform attempts to improve prevention and early intervention. We evaluated the predictive value of threat-related attention bias measured immediately after a potentially traumatic event, as a risk marker for PTSD at a 3-month follow-up. We measured the predictive contribution of attentional threat bias above and beyond that of the more established marker of risk for PTSD, self-reported psychological dissociation. Method Dissociation symptoms and threat-related attention bias were measured in 577 motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors (mean age = 35.02 years, 356 males) within 24 h of admission to an emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital. PTSD symptoms were assessed at a 3-month follow-up using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Results Self-reported dissociation symptoms significantly accounted for 16% of the variance in PTSD at follow-up, and attention bias toward threat significantly accounted for an additional 4% of the variance in PTSD. Conclusions Threat-related attention bias can be reliably measured in the context of a hospital ED and significantly predicts risk for later PTSD.

These promising findings underscore the need for investigators to delineate the conditions under which CBM-A procedures are effective. In the present research we conducted two studies to empirically determine whether CBM-A continues to be effective when participants are informed of the training contingency and instructed to actively practice the target pattern of attentional selectivity. These studies were designed to address two key questions relating to this issue. First, if participants are informed of the training contingency and instructed to practice the target pattern of attentional selectivity, then will the CBM-A manipulation still effectively modify attentional response to negative information? Second, if it does still modify attentional response to negative information under these conditions, then will this change in attentional selectivity still serve to alter anxiety responses to a stressful experience? The results indicate that when participants are informed of the training contingency and instructed to practice the target pattern of attentional selectivity, then the CBM-A manipulation continues to exert an impact on attentional selectivity, but this modification of attentional bias no longer affects anxiety reactivity to a subsequent stressor. We discuss both the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Anxiety; Attentional bias modification; Explicit information; Practice instruction","anxiety; article; attentional bias; awareness; cognitive bias; cognitive bias modification procedures targeting attention; comparative study; human; questionnaire; stress; task performance; training","DP0879589, ARC, Australian Research Council; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045","Acknowledgments This work was supported by Australian Research Council Grant DP0879589, and by a grant from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS-UEFI-SCDI, Project Number PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896451472

However, as the proportion of clinical significant change has room for improvement, new treatments should be developed and investigated. A novel treatment is attention bias modification (ABM). This study aimed at evaluating the combination of ABM and ICBT. We compared two groups, one group receiving ICBT and ABM targeting attentional avoidance and the other group receiving ICBT and control training. ABM and control training tasks were both based on the dot-probe paradigm. A total of 133 participants, diagnosed with SAD, were randomised to these two groups. The attention training group (N = 66) received 2 weeks of daily attention training followed by 9 weeks of ICBT. The control group (N = 67) received 2 weeks of daily control training, also followed by 9 weeks of ICBT. Social anxiety measures as well as the attention bias were assessed at pre-assessment, at week 2, and at post-treatment. Results showed no significant differences between the attention training group and the control group. Both groups improved substantially on social anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-assessment (dwithin = 1.39-1.41), but showed no change in attention processes (dwithin = 0.10-0.17). In this trial, the attention modification training failed to induce differential change in attention bias. Results demonstrate that the applied ABM procedure with its focus on the reduction of attentional avoidance was ineffective in the Internet-based setting. The results do not suggest that adding ABM targeting attentional avoidance to ICBT results in better outcomes than ICBT alone. © 2013 The Author(s).

However, serious issues with the task have been raised. Specifically, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability. In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task. However, when attention is measured in the dot-probe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate. To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96). As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability. Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety. By contrast, the N2pc revealed a significant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable. However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task. Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations. © 2014 Kappenman, Farrens, Luck and Proudfit.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Dot probe; ERPs; IAPS; N2pc; Reliability; Threat",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923373281

This study used behavioral tasks, as well as self-report measures, to examine processing of social rank-related cues and implicit self-concept in participants with EDs. Method Fifty healthy participants (HCs), 46 people with an ED, and 22 people recovered from an ED (REC) undertook an attentional bias task using social rank-related cues and an implicit self-evaluation task. In addition, they completed self-report measures of social comparison, submissive behavior, and shame. Results People with EDs showed vigilance toward social rank-related stimuli and lower implicit positive self-evaluation than HCs. Self-report data confirmed the behavioral findings and showed that people with EDs had higher levels of unfavorable social comparison, submissive behaviors, and external and internal shame than HCs. People who had recovered from an ED showed an intermediate profile between the two groups. Discussion People with EDs have heightened sensitivity to social rank-related cues and impaired self-evaluation at an automatic level of processing.

In particular, neural mechanisms of threat disengagement, a clinically relevant construct, have been inadequately explored. Method During fMRI acquisition, 121 youth (ages 9-13; 90 with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, and/or Social Phobia; 31 nonanxious controls) completed a dot-probe task, which required participants to identify the location of a dot replacing either a neutral or fearful face in a pair containing both faces. We assessed neural substrates of threat disengagement by comparing congruent trials (in which the dot replaces the fearful face) to incongruent trials (in which the dot replaces the neutral face). Results Across subjects, decreased rostrodorsal anterior cingulate cortex (rdACC) activity was observed specifically during incongruent trials. Nonanxious youth showed a convergent pattern in bilateral parahippocampal and hippocampal regions, whereas anxious youth showed an opposing pattern in these limbic areas, suggesting less integration of response across cortical and limbic areas relevant to threat appraisal. Reduced functional connectivity between rdACC and left parahippocampus/hippocampus was associated with greater anxiety. Conclusions In the largest dot-probe fMRI sample to date, both anxious and nonanxious youth showed a neural pattern consistent with successful disengagement of threat reactivity in the rdACC. However, anxious youth showed evidence of abnormal disengagement in bilateral parahippocampal/hippocampal clusters when attention was directed away from threat. Early interventions targeting neural mechanisms of threat disengagement may be beneficial, for example, by increasing integration across rdACC and limbic regions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anxiety; attentional bias; dot-probe task; fMRI; pediatric","adolescent; adolescent disease; angular gyrus; anterior cingulate; article; attention deficit disorder; child; childhood disease; controlled study; Dot probe task; early intervention; fear; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; fusiform gyrus; generalized anxiety disorder; hippocampus; human; inferior temporal gyrus; limbic cortex; major clinical study; major depression; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; phobia; posterior insula; precuneus; priority journal; psychologic test; school child; separation anxiety; social phobia; anxiety disorder; attention; brain; cingulate gyrus; connectome; devices; facial expression; female; male; nerve cell network; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parahippocampal gyrus; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; physiology; procedures; Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Anxiety, Separation; Attention; Cerebrum; Child; Connectome; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Gyrus Cinguli; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Neuropsychological Tests; Parahippocampal Gyrus; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Phobic Disorders",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895920034

Oxytocin is a neuromodulatory hormone involved in social emotional processing associated with attentional processes. This study aimed to examine the impact of oxytocin on attentional processes to social faces representing anger, disgust, and happiness in patients with anorexia nervosa.METHOD: A double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design was used. Intranasal oxytocin or placebo followed by a visual probe detection task with faces depicting anger, disgust, and happiness was administered to 64 female subjects: 31 patients with anorexia nervosa and 33 control students.RESULTS: Attentional bias to the disgust stimuli was observed in both groups under the placebo condition. The attentional bias to disgust was reduced under the oxytocin condition (a moderate effect in the patient group). Avoidance of angry faces was observed in the patient group under the placebo condition and vigilance was observed in the healthy comparison group; both of these information processing responses were moderated by oxytocin producing an increase in vigilance in the patients. Happy/smiling faces did not elicit an attentional response in controls or the patients under either the placebo or oxytocin conditions.CONCLUSION: Oxytocin attenuated attentional vigilance to disgust in patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy controls. On the other hand, oxytocin changed the response to angry faces from avoidance to vigilance in patients but reduced vigilance to anger in healthy controls. We conclude that patients with anorexia nervosa appear to use different strategies/circuits to emotionally process anger from their healthy counterparts.",,"agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; oxytocin; adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; attention; case control study; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; drug effects; emotion; female; human; intranasal drug administration; psychology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; young adult; Administration, Intranasal; Adolescent; Adult; Anorexia Nervosa; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Female; Humans; Neurotransmitter Agents; Oxytocin; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925545986

This study investigated whether the verbal nature of worry contributes to the maintenance of worry by enhancing attention to threat. It was hypothesised that verbal worry would lead to greater attentional bias to threat than imagery-based worry. Methods Fifty high-worriers were randomly assigned to one of two groups, one in which they were instructed to worry in a verbal way and one in which they worried in an imagery-based way, before completing a dot probe task as a measure of attention to threat-related words. Results Those who worried in verbal form demonstrated greater attentional bias to threat than did those who worried in imagery-based form. These findings could not be accounted for by group differences in personal relevance of or distress associated with worry topics, state mood following worry, levels of the relatedness of participants' worries to stimuli on the dot probe task, trait anxiety, general propensity to worry, nor adherence to the worry training. Limitations The present study only included word stimuli in the dot probe task; inclusion of images would allow for firmly rejecting the hypothesis that the attention effects observed following verbal worry were merely a result of priming verbal threat representations. Also, future studies could include a further control group that does not engage in any form of worry to ascertain that verbal worry increased attentional bias rather than imagery decreasing pre-existing attentional bias.

However, there has been theoretical disagreement concerning whether anxiety-linked attentional biases reflect enhanced attentional engagement with, or impaired attentional disengagement from, negative information. We contend that previous methodologies have not been optimal in terms of their capacity to differentiate both types of bias. The present study introduces a refined methodology, in which the conventional dot-probe task is modified in a novel manner to enable the independent assessment of these components of attention. The findings demonstrate that facilitated attentional engagement and impaired attentional disengagement are both characteristic of elevated levels of anxiety vulnerability. Moreover, these prove to be unrelated facets of attentional selectivity that independently contribute to variation in anxiety vulnerability. We discuss the possibility that these two types of attentional bias may represent independent pathways to anxiety vulnerability. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Disengagement; Dot-probe task; Engagement","analytic method; anxiety; article; attentional bias; cognitive development; controlled study; female; human; information; male; negative information; priority journal; selective attention; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Attention; Cognition; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Personality Inventory; Photic Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Young Adult","DP0879589, ARC, Australian Research Council; 10.1080/ 02699931.2013.854514; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045; UWA, University of Western Australia; UWA, University of Western Australia","Correspondence should be addressed to: Daniel Rudaizky, Centre for the Advancement of Research on Emotion, School of Psychology, M304, The University of Western Australia M304, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley WA 6009, Australia.

We also measured N2pc to face onset as an index of early attentional capture. At long SOA only, frontal and parietal asymmetry interacted to predict attentional bias to angry faces. Those with leftward frontal asymmetry showed no attentional bias. Among those with rightward frontal asymmetry those with low right parietal activity showed vigilance for threat, and those with high right parietal activity showed avoidance. Asymmetry was not related to the N2pc or to attentional bias at the short SOA.

However, little is known about the temporal parameters of these stages and the degree to which they influence attentional processing. In the current study, 155 participants completed a dot-probe task to examine these questions. On each trial, humor versus control, novel (incongruent but not humorous) versus control, or neutral versus neutral image pairs were presented for 300, 400, or 500 ms. A probe immediately replaced the experimental image (valid trial) or control image (invalid trial). An attentional bias toward humor and novelty by 300 ms was shown by faster probe-detection reaction times (RTs) on valid compared to invalid humor and novel trials for all three exposure times. When compared to the neutral trials, humor and novel stimuli elicited slower RTs, indicating a difficulty in attentional disengagement. An exploratory analysis found that subjective humor ratings predicted the disengagement bias at 500 ms, but not at 400 or 300 ms.

Forty-five minutes following the administration of 40 IU of intranasal oxytocin or a placebo, the participants were presented with two dot probe tests with pairs of face stimuli depicting emotional and neutral faces in adults. Results: Oxytocin specifically reduced the attention bias toward the location of the faces of adults showing negative emotions, particularly in the case of disgust. Oxytocin did not enhance the attentional bias toward adult happy faces. The effect of oxytocin toward adult negative emotion was correlated with the sensitivity of the drive in the behavioral motivational system.

Recently, the investigation of this spatial-numerical association has been extended to mental arithmetic with the hypothesis that solving addition or subtraction problems may induce attentional displacements (to the right and to the left, respectively) along a mental number line onto which the magnitude of the numbers would range from left to right, from small to large numbers. Here we investigated such attentional shifts using a target detection task primed by arithmetic problems in healthy participants. The constituents of the addition and subtraction problems (first operand; operator; second operand) were flashed sequentially in the centre of a screen, then followed by a target on the left or the right side of the screen, which the participants had to detect. This paradigm was employed with arithmetic facts (Experiment 1) and with more complex arithmetic problems (Experiment 2) in order to assess the effects of the operation, the magnitude of the operands, the magnitude of the results, and the presence or absence of a requirement for the participants to carry or borrow numbers. The results showed that arithmetic operations induce some spatial shifts of attention, possibly through a semantic link between the operation and space. © 2014 © 2014 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Attentional shifts; Mental arithmetic; Operational momentum; Visuospatial attention","adolescent; analysis of variance; attention; female; human; male; mathematics; perceptive discrimination; photostimulation; physiology; problem solving; reaction time; statistical bias; young adult; Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Photic Stimulation; Problem Solving; Reaction Time; Signal Detection, Psychological; Young Adult","A057.12","Correspondence should be addressed to Mauro Pesenti, Centre de Neuroscience Système et Cognition, Institut de Recherche en Sciences Psychologiques, Université catholique de Louvain, Place Cardinal Mercier, 10, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

Evidence suggests that fixation time is a more direct measure of attentional bias than response time. The aims of this experiment were to demonstrate that fixation time during the visual probe task is a sensitive and stable measure of cocaine cue attentional bias in cocaine-using adults compared to controls. Design: A between-subject, repeated-measures experiment. Setting: An out-patient research unit. Participants: Fifteen cocaine using and 15 non-cocaine-using adults recruited from the community. Measurements: Participants completed a visual probe task with eye tracking and a modified Stroop during two experimental sessions. Findings: A significant interaction between cue type and group (F=13.5; P<0.05) indicated that cocaine users, but not controls, displayed an attentional bias to cocaine-related images as measured by fixation time. There were no changes in the magnitude of attentional bias across sessions (F=3.4; P>0.05) and attentional bias correlated with self-reported life-time cocaine use (r=0.64, P<0.05).

Previous research reported attentional biases during stimulus processing in anxiety and depression. However, sex differences in the processing of emotional stimuli and higher prevalence rates of anxiety disorders among women, compared to men, suggest that attentional biases may also differ between the two sexes. The present study used a modified version of the dot probe task with happy, angry, and neutral facial stimuli to investigate the time course of attentional biases in healthy volunteers. Moreover, associations of attentional biases with alexithymia were examined on the behavioral and physiological level. Event-related potentials were measured while 21 participants (11 women) performed the task, utilizing also for the first time a difference wave approach in the analysis to highlight emotion-specific aspects. Women showed overall enhanced probe P1 amplitudes compared to men, in particular after rewarding facial stimuli. Using the difference wave approach, probe P1 amplitudes appeared specifically enhanced with regard to congruently presented happy facial stimuli among women, compared to men. Both methods yielded enhanced probe P1 amplitudes after presentation of the emotional stimulus in the left compared to the right visual hemifield. Probe P1 amplitudes correlated negatively with self-reported alexithymia, most of these correlations were only observable in women. Our results suggest that women orient their attention to a greater extent to facial stimuli than men and corroborate that alexithymia is a correlate of reduced emotional reactivity on a neuronal level. We recommend using a difference wave approach when addressing attentional processes of orientation and disengagement also in future studies. ï¿½ 2014 Pfabigan, Lamplmayr-Kragl, Pintzinger, Sailer and Tran.","Alexithymia; Attentional bias; Difference wave approach; Dot probe paradigm; Probe P1 amplitudes; Sex differences",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987920115

Yet, little is known about the anatomical pathway by which threat biases cognition and how genetic factors might influence the integrity of this pathway, and thus, behavior. For 40 normative adults, we reconstructed the entire amygdalo-prefrontal white matter tract (uncinate fasciculus) using diffusion tensor weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography to test the hypothesis that greater fiber integrity correlates with greater nonconscious attention bias to threat as measured by a backward masked dot-probe task. We used path analysis to investigate the relationship between brain-derived nerve growth factor genotype, uncinate fasciculus integrity, and attention bias behavior. Greater structural integrity of the amygdalo-prefrontal tract correlates with facilitated attention bias to nonconscious threat. Genetic variability associated with brain-derived nerve growth factor appears to influence the microstructure of this pathway and, in turn, attention bias to nonconscious threat. These results suggest that the integrity of amygdalo-prefrontal projections underlie nonconscious attention bias to threat and mediate genetic influence on attention bias behavior. Prefrontal cognition and attentional processing in high bias individuals appear to be heavily influenced by nonconscious threat signals relayed via the uncinate fasciculus. © The Author 2013.

Like other addictive behaviors, risk of opioid misuse may be signaled by an attentional bias (AB) towards drug-related cues. The purpose of this study was to examine opioid AB as a potential predictor of opioid misuse among chronic pain patients following behavioral treatment. Methods: Chronic pain patients taking long-term opioid analgesics (n=. 47) completed a dot probe task designed to assess opioid AB, as well as self-report measures of opioid misuse and pain severity, and then participated in behavioral treatment. Regression analyses examined opioid AB and cue-elicited craving as predictors of opioid misuse at 3-month posttreatment follow-up. Results: Patients who scored high on a measure of opioid misuse risk following treatment exhibited significantly greater opioid AB scores than patients at low risk for opioid misuse. Opioid AB for 200ms cues and cue-elicited craving significantly predicted opioid misuse risk 20 weeks later, even after controlling for pre-treatment opioid dependence diagnosis, opioid misuse, and pain severity (Model R2=.50). Conclusion: Biased initial attentional orienting to prescription opioid cues and cue-elicited craving may reliably signal future opioid misuse risk following treatment. These measures may therefore provide potential prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Attentional bias; Chronic pain; Cue-reactivity; Dot probe; Implicit cognition; Opioid misuse","narcotic analgesic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; Article; association; attentional bias; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; drug misuse; female; follow up; human; male; mindfulness; opiate addiction; prediction; prescription; randomized controlled trial (topic); regression analysis; risk assessment; scoring system; self report; task performance; withdrawal syndrome; attention; chronic pain; drug misuse; middle aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; predictive value; psychology; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Attention; Chronic Pain; Craving; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; Predictive Value of Tests; Prescription Drug Misuse; Risk Factors; Self Report","NIH, National Institutes of Health; Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation; NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse","This work was supported by grant numbers DA032517 and DA037005 from the National Institutes of Health awarded to ELG.; and a grant from the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, also awarded to ELG.

The current study aimed to provide initial support for this model in adolescent EDs, through examining the interaction between an adolescent's emotional vulnerability, indexed by attentional biases for emotions, and an invalidating family environment. Specifically, we examined the ability of this interaction to discriminate youth with EDs from a comparison group of youth with chronic pain diagnoses, who were used to control for the presence of non-specific effects of having any illness. Fifty adolescent girls (25 with EDs and 25 with chronic pain) completed an emotional dot-probe task assessing attentional biases for emotional faces, and parents completed the Emotions as a Child Scale (Magai, 1996; Klimes-Dougan et al., 2007) to assess response to teen emotion. Results showed that teen angry attentional bias moderated the relationship between parental response to sadness and teen ED status: for teens with high attention bias towards angry faces, maladaptive parental response to sadness predicted increased odds of ED status versus chronic pain status. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescent eating disorders; Attention bias; Emotion regulation; Emotion socialization; Family emotion processes","adolescent; anger; article; attentional bias; child; child parent relation; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; eating disorder; emotional dot probe task; emotionality; Emotions as a Child Scale; facial expression; family interaction; family life; female; human; loneliness; maladjustment; parental attitude; priority journal; psychologic test; psychological rating scale; school child; self report; attention; child parent relation; chronic pain; comparative study; eating disorder; emotion; male; parent; physiology; psychology; abdominal pain; adolescent behavior; adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; backache; chronic pain; complex regional pain syndrome; DSM-IV; eating disorder; musculoskeletal pain; neuropathic pain; parental attitude; sadness; social aspect; transformed migraine; Adolescent; Anger; Attention; Chronic Pain; Eating Disorders; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Parents","CWRU, Case Western Reserve University","This study was supported by Brisky Fellowship fund from the Schubert Center for Child Studies , awarded to A.

Aims: The aim is to investigate the time-course of attentional bias for positive social words in participants with high and low social anxiety. Method: In a modified dot-probe task, word-pairs of neutral and positive social words were randomly presented for 100, 500, and 1250 milliseconds in a nonclinical sample of students to test their attentional bias. Results: Non-significant interaction of Group × Exposure Duration was found. However, there was a significant main effect of group, with significantly different response latencies between the high social anxiety (HSA) and low social anxiety (LSA) groups in the 100 ms condition, without for 500 or 1250 ms. With respect to attentional bias, the LSA group showed enhanced preferential attention for positive social words to which the HSA group showed avoidance in the 100 ms condition. In the 500 ms condition, preferential attention to positive social words was at trend in the LSA group, relative to the HSA group. Neither group showed attentional bias in the 1250 ms condition. Conclusions: These findings extend recent research about the attention training program and add to the empirical literature suggesting that the initial avoidance of positive stimuli may contribute to maintaining social anxiety. © 2013 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.","Attentional bias; dot-probe paradigm; positive social words; social anxiety","adolescent; adult; affect; attention; China; defense mechanism; female; human; human relation; male; paired associate learning; perception; Phobic Disorders; psychology; reaction time; semantics; speech perception; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Attention; China; Defense Mechanisms; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Paired-Associate Learning; Phobic Disorders; Reaction Time; Semantics; Social Perception; Speech Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901409466

Objectives: We examined effects of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) on reward responsiveness (RR) and opioid cue-reactivity in a sample of chronic pain patients with opioid use problems. We previously reported that MORE decreased pain, opioid misuse, and craving relative to a social support control group (SG). Here, we examined whether these outcomes were linked to changes in RR in a subset of participants. Methods: Participants were chronic pain patients (71 % women, age 46.6∈±∈13.9) who received MORE (n∈=∈20) or SG (n∈=∈29). RR was measured before and after 8 weeks of treatment via heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) responses during a dot probe task that included opioid-related, pain-related, and natural reward stimuli, as well as craving ratings. Results: The MORE group, who reported decreased opioid misuse and opioid craving during treatment, evidenced less subjective opioid cue-reactivity, greater HR decelerations, and greater increases in HRV to all cues after treatment compared to the SG; HR and HRV effects were most pronounced for natural reward cues. Within the MORE group, HR deceleration to natural reward cues was correlated with increased subjective arousal to the cues, whereas HR deceleration to opioid cues was correlated with decreased subjective arousal. Effects of MORE on craving were mediated by enhanced RR. Conclusions: Results suggest that during treatment with MORE, cardiac-autonomic responsiveness to non-drug reward increases, while reactivity to opioid reward decreases. Studies are needed to discern whether changes in RR were a result or a determinant of reductions in opioid misuse and craving. RR may play a role in addiction treatment. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Addiction; Allostasis; Attentional bias; Chronic pain; Cue-reactivity; Heart rate variability; Mindfulness; Opioid misuse; Positive affect; Reward","opiate; adult; analysis of variance; arousal; article; attention; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; deceleration; dot probe task; drug misuse; emotion; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; intervention study; male; mindfulness oriented recovery enhancement; neurotransmitter release; opioid cue reactivity; outcome assessment; priority journal; psychologic assessment; reward; social support; treatment duration; withdrawal syndrome; affect; association; chronic pain; complication; drug misuse; middle aged; mindfulness; Opioid-Related Disorders; psychology; reward; self report; Adult; Affect; Arousal; Attention; Chronic Pain; Cues; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Opioid-Related Disorders; Prescription Drug Misuse; Reward; Self Report","NIH, National Institutes of Health; Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation","Acknowledgments This work was supported by grant numbers DA032517 and DA037005 from the National Institutes of Health awarded to E.L.G. and a grant from the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, also awarded to E.L.G.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904994500

We investigated whether general cognitive function evaluated with a standard neuropsychological test predicts biased cognition, focusing on attentional bias toward threat.Methods: One hundred and five healthy young adults completed a dot-probe task measuring attentional bias and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) measuring general cognitive function, which consists of five domains: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between attentional bias and cognitive function.Results: The attentional domain was the best predictor of attentional bias toward threat (Β =3D -0.26, p =3D 0.006). Within the attentional domain, digit symbol coding was negatively correlated with attentional bias (r =3D -0.28, p =3D 0.005).Conclusions: The present study provides the first evidence that general attentional ability, which was assessed with a standard neuropsychological test, affects attentional bias toward threatening information.

There has been considerable recent interest in determining whether this attentional bias reflects facilitated attentional engagement with and/or impaired attentional disengagement from negative information. We concur with the claim of investigators who have noted that the methodologies previously employed to dissociate engagement and disengagement biases are not optimal for this purpose. In the present study, we employ a novel methodology, the Attentional Response to Distal vs. Proximal Emotional Information (ARDPEI) task, which enables the discrete assessment of these two types of attentional selectivity. The findings demonstrate that facilitated attentional engagement with and impaired attentional disengagement from negative information both characterise elevated anxiety vulnerability. Further, these biases represent distinctive facets of anxiety-linked attentional selectivity. We discuss the potentially differing roles that engagement and disengagement biases may play in the development and/or maintenance of anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Disengagement; Dot-probe task; Emotional spatial cuing task; Engagement","adolescent; anxiety; attention; female; human; male; photostimulation; psychology; psychomotor performance; young adult; Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Young Adult","DP14010448, ARC, Australian Research Council; PNII-ID-PCCE-2011-2-0045, UEFISCDI, Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii; M304, UWA, University of Western Australia; CNCS, Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice","Correspondence should be addressed to: Ben Grafton, Centre for the Advancement of Research in Emotion, School of Psychology, The University of Western Australia, M304, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley WA 6009, Australia.

Despite suggestions about the importance of attentional biases in the maintenance of eating disorder psychopathology, research on this topic is limited. The majority of studies in this field have used the modified Stroop task which is at best a weak test of attention, as delayed color-naming latencies can arise from attention directed either towards or away from relevant stimuli. On the other hand, the second popular (though less than the previous one) test of attentional bias, namely the dot probe task, does not differentiate between vigilance and difficulty to disengage attention. The spatial cueing task is the third popular paradigm to measure attentional bias, but does not allow any individual to identify differences in the tendency to initially prioritize the assignment of attention to relevant stimuli. A perspective on using a new paradigm of measuring attentional bias in eating disorders is proposed, to make it possible differentiating between three components of attentional bias. Beyond the analysis of these spatial phenomena, the chapter includes the analysis of their temporal characteristics. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Recent research has shown that people experience envy in two distinct forms: malicious envy, which is associated with the motivation to harm the position of a superior other, and benign envy, which is associated with the motivation to improve oneself by moving upward. Based on a functional account of the two forms of envy, we predicted that within malicious envy the cognitive system is geared more strongly toward the other person than toward the superior fortune of the other. In contrast, only within benign envy the cognitive system should be geared toward opportunities to level oneself up. We investigated these hypotheses with dot probe tasks. In line with our reasoning, Experiments 1 (N= 84) and 2 (N= 78) demonstrate that within malicious envy, attention is biased more toward the envied person than toward the envy object, whereas in benign envy, this difference does not occur. Experiment 3 (N= 104) provides evidence that within benign envy, but not in malicious envy, attention is biased toward means to improve one's own outcome. The results suggest that within benign and malicious envy, early cognitive processing is tuned toward different stimuli and thus highlight the utility of functional and process-oriented approaches to studying envy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Attention; Emotion; Envy; Social comparison",,"DFG, California Department of Fish and Game","This research was supported by a Leibniz Award from the German Science Foundation (DFG).

Recently, safety researchers have paid greater attention to the role of implicit processes. Our research focuses on the role of attentional bias toward safety (ABS) in workplace safety. ABS is a basic, early-stage cognitive process involving the automatic and selective allocation of attentional resources toward safety cues, which reflect the implicit motivational state of employees regarding safety goal. In this study, we used two reaction time-based paradigms to measure the ABS of employees in three studies: two modified Stroop tasks (Studies 1 and 2) and a visual dot-probe task (Study 3). Results revealed that employees with better safety behavior showed significant ABS (Study 2), and greater ABS than employees with poorer safety behavior (Studies 1 and 2).

Moreover, it has been shown that attentional bias plays an important role in depression vulnerability. The current study aimed to examine the interplay between these risk factors for depression by examining the development of attentional bias toward reward and loss signals in dysphoric participants (individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms). Methods Shapes were conditioned to reward and loss and subsequently presented in a dot probe task in a sample of dysphoric and nondysphoric participants. Results Nondysphoric individuals oriented towards reward-related signals whereas dysphoric individuals failed to develop a reward-related attentional bias. This attentional effect was observed in the absence of group differences in motivational factors. No group differences were found for attentional bias for loss-related signals, despite the fact that dysphoric individuals performed worse in response to losing. Limitations The current sample is not clinical thus generalization to clinical depression is not warranted.

Using a correlational design, the present study assessed avoidance in a dot-probe task, along with anxiety and two aspects of goal-driven executive control: Shifting and inhibition. Avoidance of threat correlated with state of anxiety; separate from this, avoidance also correlated negatively with shifting performance and was unrelated to inhibition performance.

Ninety-nine outpatients with schizophrenia and 131 healthy controls performed 5 tasks assessing 4 constructs at 3 sessions. The constructs were (1) Goal maintenance (Dot Probe Expectancy [DPX] and AX continuous performance tasks [AX-CPT]); (2) Episodic memory (Relational and Item-Specific Encoding and Retrieval task [RiSE]); (3) Visual integration (Jittered Orientation Visual Integration task [JOVI]); and (4) Perceptual gain control (Contrast-Contrast Effect Task [CCE]). Patients performed worse than controls on all but the CCE, and the magnitude of these group differences was stable across sessions, with no sex differences observed. Improvements over sessions were seen for the AX-CPT, the DPX, and the JOVI though practice effects for the AX-CPT and the DPX were primarily present in older participants. For the AX-CPT and the JOVI, practice effects were larger for T1 to T2 than for T2 to T3. Age was associated with poor associative recognition on the RiSE and accuracy on the JOVI. Test-rest reliability ranged from poor for the JOVI threshold score to adequate to good for the DPX, AX-CPT, and JOVI accuracy measures, with RiSE and CCE measures in the moderate range. These results suggest that group differences in DPX, AX-CPT, RiSE, and JOVI are robust and consistent across repeated testing. © 2014 The Author.","cognitive neuroscience; episodic memory; goal maintenance; psychometrics; schizophrenia; visual integration","adult; age; aged; article; ax continuous performance task; continuous performance test; controlled study; dot probe expectancy; episodic memory; ethnicity; female; human; jittered orientation visual integration; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; neuropsychological test; priority journal; race; recognition; relational and item specific encoding and retrieval task; schizophrenia; sex; social status; task performance; Temporal stability; test retest reliability; age; attention; case control study; cognitive defect; middle aged; motivation; multilevel analysis; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; schizophrenia; sex difference; vision; Adult; Age Factors; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cognition Disorders; Female; Goals; Humans; Male; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Multilevel Analysis; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Sex Factors; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902584708

The current study investigated attentional bias towards health-threat stimuli in CFS. It also examined whether individuals with CFS have impaired executive attention, and whether this was related to attentional bias. 27 participants with CFS and 35 healthy controls completed a Visual Probe Task measuring attentional bias, and an Attention Network Test measuring executive attention, alerting and orienting. Participants also completed self-report measures of CFS and mood symptoms. Compared to the control group, the CFS group showed greater attentional bias for health-threat words than pictures; and the CFS group was significantly impaired in executive attention. Furthermore, CFS individuals with poor executive attention showed greater attentional bias to health-threat related words, compared not only to controls but also to CFS individuals with good executive attention. Thus, this study revealed a significant relationship between attentional bias and executive attention in CFS: attentional bias to threat was primarily evident in those with impaired executive attention control.

Attentional bias to salient cues has been observed in substance addictions, and to some extent, in problem gamblers. This bias appears to be indicative of an increase in sensitisation to salient cues as a result of continued reforcement of a related behaviour. To test for an attentional bias to gambling-related stimuli in non-problem gamblers, the relationships between gambling frequency, gambling attitudes and beliefs (GABS-23), and attentional bias were investigated. Participants (N = 38) viewed simultaneous pairs of gambling-related and neutral images and performed a dot probe task, during which their eye-movements were recorded. This enabled both direct and indirect measures of attentional bias to be obtained. Gambling frequency and GABS-23 scores predicted both direct and indirect measures of a bias in the maintenance of attention to gambling cues. No bias in attentional engagement was found. These results suggest that regular gamblers who have not yet developed any related problems show signs of sensitisation to gambling cues and may be at risk of progressing further towards problem gambling. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Attentional bias; Attitudes; Eye-tracking; Gambling","attentional bias; clinical article; eye movement; gambling; human; sensitization; stimulus; addiction; adult; association; attention; attentional blink; Australia; female; gambling; male; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; young adult; Adult; Attention; Attentional Blink; Australia; Behavior, Addictive; Cues; Female; Gambling; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961869802

Evidence suggests that cocaine-dependent patients with BPD are at greater risk for negative clinical outcomes than cocaine-dependent patients without BPD and BPD-SUD patients dependent on other substances. Despite evidence that cocaine-dependent patients with BPD may be at particularly high risk for negative SUD outcomes, the mechanisms underlying this risk remain unclear. The present study sought to address this gap in the literature by examining cocaine-related attentional biases among cocaine-dependent patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 36) BPD.

Findings revealed a greater bias for attending to cocaine-related stimuli among male cocaine-dependent patients with (vs. without) BPD following the emotionally evocative script. Study findings suggest the possibility that cocaine use may have gender-specific functions among SUD patients with BPD, with men with BPD being more likely to use cocaine to decrease contextually induced emotional distress.

Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine the effect of anticipatory processing on attentional bias for internal (i.e., heart rate feedback) and external (i.e., emotional faces) threat information. A sample of 59 participants high (HSA) and low (LSA) in social anxiety symptoms engaged in a modified dot-probe task prior to (Time 1) and after (Time 2) an anticipatory processing or distraction task. HSAs who anticipated experienced an increase in attentional bias for internal information from Time 1 to Time 2, whereas HSAs in the distraction condition and LSAs in either condition experienced no changes. No changes in biases were found for HSAs for external biases, but LSAs who engaged in the distraction task became less avoidant of emotional faces from Time 1 to Time 2. This suggests that anticipatory processing results in an activation of attentional biases for physiological information as suggested by Clark and Wells. © 2014.","Anticipatory processing; Attentional bias; Combined cognitive bias hypothesis; Social anxiety","adult; anticipation; anxiety; arousal; article; attentional bias; controlled study; distractibility; emotion; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; response time; Social anxiety; task performance; adolescent; anticipation; anxiety; attention; cognition; cognitive therapy; physiology; procedures; psychologic test; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; therapy; Adolescent; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Anxiety; Attention; Cognition; Cognitive Therapy; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Psychological Tests; Questionnaires",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904179765

A recently expanded cognitive-behavioural model of SAD emphasizes that both the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) contribute to enduring symptoms of SAD. Research also suggests that socially anxious individuals may show biases toward threat relevant stimuli, such as angry faces. The current study utilised a modified version of the pictorial dot-probe task in order to examine whether FNE and FPE mediate the relationship between social anxiety and an attentional bias. A group of 38 participants with moderate to high levels of self-reported social anxiety were tested in groups of two to four people and were advised that they would be required to deliver an impromptu speech. All participants then completed an assessment of attentional bias using angry-neutral, happy-neutral, and angry-happy face pairs. Conditions were satisfied for only one mediation model, indicating that the relationship between social anxiety and attentional avoidance of angry faces was mediated by FPE.

Participants were selected a priori depending on their 5-HTTLPR (s/s, s/l, l/l; on a constant rs25531 A-allele background) and COMTval158met (val/val, valmet, met/met) genotypes and were matched for sex and age. We demonstrate a bias towards angry male faces (as opposed to happy male faces) irrespective of 5-HTTLPR genotype in the first experimental block that was maintained during the second experimental block only in carriers of the s-allele, which implies differential habituation processes.

Although impaired recognition of affective facial expressions has been conclusively linked to antisocial behavior, little is known about the modifiability of this deficit. This study investigated whether and under which circumstances the proposed perceptual insensitivity can be addressed with a brief implicit training approach. Method. Facial affect recognition was assessed with an animated morph task, in which the participants (44 male incarcerated violent offenders and 43 matched controls) identified the onset of emotional expressions in animated morph clips that gradually changed from neutral to one of the six basic emotions. Half of the offenders were then implicitly trained to direct attention to salient face regions (attention training, AT) using a modified dot-probe task. The other half underwent the same protocol but the intensity level of the presented expressions was additionally manipulated over the course of training sessions (sensitivity to emotional expressions training, SEE training). Subsequently, participants were reassessed with the animated morph task. Results. Facial affect recognition was significantly impaired in violent offenders as compared with controls. Further, our results indicate that only the SEE training group exhibited a pronounced improvement in emotion recognition. Conclusions. We demonstrated for the first time that perceptual insensitivity to facial affect can be addressed by an implicit training that directs attention to salient regions of a face and gradually decreases the intensity of the emotional expression. Future studies should focus on the potential of this intervention to effectively increase empathy and inhibit violent behavior in antisocial individuals.

Simon (1967) postulated that one feature of emotion and cognition integration would be reciprocal connectedness (i.e., emotion influences cognition and cognition influences emotion). We explored whether affective judgments and attention to affective qualities are biased by the activation of verbal and spatial working memory mind-sets. For all experiments, participants completed a 2-back verbal or spatial working memory task followed by an endorsement task (Experiments 1 & 2), word-pair selection task (Exp. 3), or attentional dot-probe task (Exp. 4). Participants who had an activated verbal, compared with spatial, working memory mind-set were more likely to endorse pictures (Exp. 1) and words (Exp. 2) as being more positive and to select the more positive word pair out of a set of word pairs that went 'together best' (Exp. 3). Additionally, people who completed the verbal working memory task took longer to disengage from positive stimuli, whereas those who completed the spatial working memory task took longer to disengage from negative stimuli (Exp. 4). Interestingly, across the 4 experiments, we observed higher levels of self-reported negative affect for people who completed the spatial working memory task, which was consistent with their endorsement and attentional bias toward negative stimuli. Therefore, emotion and working memory may have a reciprocal connectedness allowing for bidirectional influence. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Attention; Emotion; Judgment; Working memory","affective tone; amygdaloid nucleus; anxiety; arousal; Article; attention; cognition; controlled study; decision making; emotion; female; human; human experiment; inferior temporal cortex; integration; male; mood; mood check; motivation; negative feedback; normal human; picture endorsement task; post task mood check; prefrontal cortex; quality of life; regression for endorsement task; semantic memory; social interaction; spatial memory; stimulus response; task performance; verbal memory; word endorsement task; working memory; adolescent; adult; affect; attention; decision making; learning; linguistics; photostimulation; physiology; short term memory; spatial memory; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Attention; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Photic Stimulation; Spatial Memory; Task Performance and Analysis; Verbal Learning; Vocabulary; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922561978

Methods Twenty-six normal-weight (14M, 12F) and 26 overweight/obese (14M, 12F) adults completed a visual probe task and an eye-tracking paradigm. Reaction times and eye movements to food and control images were collected during both a fasted and fed condition in a counterbalanced design. Results Participants had greater visual attention towards high-energy-density food images compared to low-energy-density food images regardless of hunger condition. This was most pronounced in overweight/obese males who had significantly greater maintained attention towards high-energy-density food images when compared with their normal-weight counterparts however no between weight group differences were observed for female participants. Conclusions High-energy-density food images appear to capture visual attention more readily than low-energy-density food images. Results also suggest the possibility of an altered visual food cue-associated reward system in overweight/obese males.

Yet, empirical evidence for individual (trait) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal. Aim: The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood (vs neutral mood) on actual food intake. It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood. Method: Participants (N. = 85) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions (sad/neutral). Attentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli. Self-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer. Results: Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition. Yet, attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition, but not in the sad mood condition. Discussion: The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating (based on the DEBQ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad, at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women. Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state, and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general, but maybe not during sad mood. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention bias; Emotional eating; Eye tracking; Food intake; Mood induction","adult; article; attentional bias; caloric intake; controlled study; Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire; emotional stress; eye tracking; female; food intake; human; major clinical study; mood; obesity; overnutrition; predictive value; priority journal; psychologic test; questionnaire; risk assessment; sadness; self report; stimulus response; task performance; visual stimulation; Attention bias; Emotional eating; Eye tracking; Food intake; Mood induction; Affect; Attention; Eating; Eye Movements; Female; Food; Humans; Hyperphagia; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Self Report; Young Adult","UM, Universiteit Maastricht","Jessica Werthmann is funded by a PhD fellowship from Maastricht University .

Individuals who are highly sensitive to this effect of the drug may be at increased risk for problematic drinking, especially among those whose attention is drawn to alcohol-related cues in the environment (i.e., attentional bias). The current study examined the acute impairing effect of alcohol on inhibitory mechanisms of attentional control in a group of healthy social drinkers. We then examined whether increased sensitivity to this disinhibiting effect of alcohol was associated with heavy drinking, especially among those who have an attentional bias toward alcohol-related stimuli. Eighty nondependent social drinkers performed a delayed ocular response task that measured their inhibitory control of attention by their ability to suppress attentional shifts to irrelevant stimuli. Attentional bias was measured using a visual probe task. Inhibitory control was assessed following a moderate dose of alcohol (0.64 g/kg) and a placebo. Participants made more inhibitory failures (i.e., premature saccades) following 0.64 g/kg alcohol compared with placebo and the relation of this effect to their drinking habits did depend on the level of the drinker's attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli. Among drinkers with higher attentional bias, greater impairment of inhibitory control was associated with heavier drinking. In contrast, drinkers with little or no attentional bias showed no relation between their sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol and drinking habits. These findings have implications for understanding how heightened incentive-salience of alcohol cues and impaired attentional control can interactively contribute to excessive alcohol use. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Abuse potential; Alcohol effects; Attentional bias; Delayed ocular response task; Inhibitory control","accuracy; adult; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; article; attentional bias; binge drinking; body weight; drinking behavior; expired air; eye fixation; female; human; inhibition (psychology); major clinical study; male; mental task; response time; saccadic eye movement; selective attention; sex difference; stimulus response; vision; alcoholism; attention; psychology; Adult; Alcoholism; Attention; Female; Humans; Male",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897932239

Empirical support for this model has been repeatedly demonstrated in adult samples [for a meta-analysis, see Ref. (1)]. The purpose of this study was to test these processes as they relate to emerging alcohol use in adolescents. Specifically, the interactive effects of several measures of impulsive and reflective processes and working memory capacity (WMC) are examined as predictors of changes in alcohol use among adolescents. It was expected that measures of reflective processes would better predict changes in alcohol use than measures of impulsive processes. Moreover, it was anticipated that WMC would moderate the relation between alcohol-specific impulsive and reflective processes and changes in adolescent alcohol use. Methods: The sample consisted of 427 adolescents (47.7% male) between 12 and 16 years of age (M = 13.96, SD = 0.78) who reported drinking alcohol at least once. Four measures of impulsive processes were included. Attentional bias for alcohol was assessed with a Visual Probe Test; approach bias toward alcohol was assessed with a Stimulus Response Compatibility (SRC) Test; and memory associations with alcohol were assessed with an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and a Word Association Test. Two measures of reflective measures were included: positive and negative expectancies. WMC was measured using a Self-Ordered Pointing Task. Results: Results showed that positive expectancies predicted changes in alcohol use, but this effect was qualified by an interaction with IAT scores. Moreover, SRC scores predicted changes in alcohol use only when negative expectancies were low. Attentional bias and word association scores did not predict changes in alcohol use. The relations between alcohol-specific processes or reflective processes and alcohol use were not moderated by WMC. Conclusion: Although there is empirical evidence for the validity of the model in predicting heavier alcohol use in adolescents, or alcohol abuse and dependence in adults, these observations do not generalize to a sample of normative, early adolescents. More specifically, results indicated that reflective processes are more important predictors of changes in alcohol use than impulsive process during adolescence. © 2014 Pieters, Burk, Van der Vorst, Engels and Wiers.","Adolescents; Alcohol use; Dual process model; Explicit cognition; Implicit cognition; Working memory capacity","alcohol; adolescent; alcohol consumption; article; attentional bias; behavior change; brain function; child; controlled study; female; functional assessment; human; impulsiveness; impulsiveness process; male; mental task; prediction; process model; qualitative analysis; reflective process; school child; scoring system; social interaction; stimulus response; task performance; working memory",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904462722

There is evidence that attentional bias may contribute to craving and failure to stop smoking. Attentional retraining procedures have been used in laboratory studies to train smokers to reduce attentional bias, although these procedures have not been applied in smoking cessation programmes. This trial will examine the efficacy of multiple sessions of attentional retraining on attentional bias, craving, and abstinence in smokers attempting cessation. Methods/Design. This is a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Adult smokers attending a 7-session weekly stop smoking clinic will be randomised to either a modified visual probe task with attentional retraining or placebo training. Training will start 1 week prior to quit day and be given weekly for 5 sessions. Both groups will receive 21 mg transdermal nicotine patches for 8-12 weeks and withdrawal-orientated behavioural support for 7 sessions. Primary outcome measures are the change in attentional bias reaction time and urge to smoke on the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale at 4 weeks post-quit. Secondary outcome measures include differences in withdrawal, time to first lapse and prolonged abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit, which will be biochemically validated at each clinic visit. Follow-up will take place at 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-quit. Discussion. This is the first randomised controlled trial of attentional retraining in smokers attempting cessation.

At present, an impairment of response inhibition and a biased salience attribution to food-associated stimuli are considered as important factors associated with weight gain. However, recent findings suggest that the association between an impaired response inhibition and salience attribution and weight gain might be modulated by other factors. Thus, hunger might cause food-associated cues to be perceived as more salient and rewarding and might be associated with an impairment of response inhibition. However, at present, little is known how hunger interacts with these processes. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether hunger modulates response inhibition and attention allocation towards food-associated stimuli in normal-weight controls. A go-/nogo task with food-associated and control words and a visual dot-probe task with food-associated and control pictures were administered to 48 normal-weight participants (mean age 24.5. years, range 19-40; mean BMI 21.6, range 18.5-25.4). Hunger was assessed twofold using a self-reported measure of hunger and a measurement of the blood glucose level. Our results indicated that self-reported hunger affected behavioral response inhibition in the go-/nogo task. Thus, hungry participants committed significantly more commission errors when food-associated stimuli served as distractors compared to when control stimuli were the distractors. This effect was not observed in sated participants. In addition, we found that self-reported hunger was associated with a lower number of omission errors in response to food-associated stimuli indicating a higher salience of these stimuli. Low blood glucose level was not associated with an impairment of response inhibition. However, our results indicated that the blood glucose level was associated with an attentional bias towards food-associated cues in the visual dot probe task. In conclusion our results suggest that hunger induces an approach bias and is associated with an impairment of response inhibition when normal-weight participants are confronted with food-associated cues. These findings are important as these processes play a crucial role with regard to the control of food-intake and weight gain and are assumed to contribute to obesity. Thus, individualized treatment approaches taking into account the experience of hunger in everyday-life situations should be considered in addition to a training of response inhibition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Attentional bias; Hunger; Impulsivity; Inhibitory control; Obesity","glucose; adult; article; attention; controlled study; female; glucose blood level; human; human experiment; hunger; impulsiveness; male; self concept; Attentional bias; Hunger; Impulsivity; Inhibitory control; Obesity; Adult; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Cues; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Hunger; Hyperphagia; Impulsive Behavior; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Obesity; Questionnaires; Reward; Satiation; Weight Gain; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882808164

People with eating disorders (EDs) have difficulties with social functioning. One explanatory mechanism is a problem with over-sensitivity to rejection and/or low sensitivity to social reward. The aim of this study is to investigate attentional bias to facial stimuli in people with a lifetime diagnosis of EDs and healthy controls (HCs) and to test whether these attentional biases are linked to adverse early experiences. Methods. Forty-six participants with a current diagnosis of EDs (29 with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 17 with bulimia nervosa (BN)), 22 participants recovered from an eating disorder (13 with past AN and nine with past BN) and 50 HCs completed a dot-probe task with faces expressing rejection and acceptance. Participants reported on parental style and adverse early experiences. Results. People with a lifetime diagnosis of EDs show an attentional bias to rejecting faces and a difficulty disengaging attention from these stimuli. Also, they had a sustained attentional avoidance of accepting faces. HCs demonstrated the opposite attentional pattern. The attentional bias to rejection was correlated with adverse childhood experiences. Conclusions. People with an EDs show vigilance to rejection and avoidance of social reward.

Prior studies have identified an attentional bias (AB) towards heroin among heroin dependent individuals. The aim of this study was to determine whether opioid-dependent chronic pain patients exhibit an AB towards prescription opioid-related cues. Opioid-dependent chronic pain patients (n = 32) and a comparison group of non-dependent opioid users with chronic pain (n = 33) completed a dot probe task designed to measure opioid AB. Participants also rated their opioid craving and self-reported arousal associated with opioid-related and neutral images, pain severity, and relief from pain treatments. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group (opioid-dependent vs. non-dependent opioid user) × presentation duration (200. vs. 2,000 ms.) interaction, such that opioid-dependent individuals evidenced a significant AB towards opioid cues presented for 200 ms but not for cues presented for 2,000 ms, whereas non-dependent opioid users did not exhibit a significant mean AB at either stimulus duration. Among opioid-dependent individuals, 200 ms opioid AB was significantly associated with opioid craving, while among non-dependent opioid users, 200 ms opioid AB was significantly associated with relief from pain treatments. Furthermore, dependent and non-dependent opioid users experienced opioid cues as significantly more arousing than neutral cues. Opioid dependence among chronic pain patients appears to involve an automatic AB towards opioid-related cues. When coupled with chronic pain, attentional fixation on opioid cues may promote compulsive drug use and addictive behavior. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Attentional bias; Chronic pain; Craving; Implicit cognition; Opiate; Opioid addiction; Opioid dependence","narcotic analgesic agent; addiction; adolescent; adult; aged; article; association; attention; chronic pain; female; human; male; middle aged; opiate addiction; pain assessment; psychological aspect; severity of illness index; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Chronic Pain; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pain Measurement; Severity of Illness Index","NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse; Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation","Acknowledgments The first author (E.L.G.) was supported in developing this manuscript by Grant Number DA032517 from the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a grant from the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, and a grant from the Florida State University Council on Research and Creativity.

Food-related attentional bias may therefore play a causal role in over-eating. To test this possibility, the current study experimentally manipulated attentional bias towards food using a modified version of the visual probe task in which cake-stationery item image pairs were presented for 500. ms each. Participants ( N=. 60) were either trained to attend to images of cake, trained to avoid images of cake, or assigned to a no-training control group. Hunger was measured before and after the training. Post-training, participants were given the opportunity to consume cake as well as a non-target food (crisps) that was not included in the training. There was weak evidence of an increase in attentional bias towards cake in the attend group only. We found no selective effects of the training on hunger or food intake, and little evidence for any gender differences. Our study suggests that attentional bias for food is particularly ingrained and difficult to modify. It also represents a first step towards elucidating the potential functional significance of food-related attentional biases and the lack of behavioural effects is broadly consistent with single-session attentional training studies from the addiction literature. An alternative hypothesis, that attentional bias represents a noncausal proxy for the motivational impact of appetitive stimuli, is considered. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Addiction; Attentional training; Craving; Food intake; Hunger; Incentive salience","adult; appetite; article; attention; attentional bias; controlled study; female; food intake; food preference; human; male; normal human; reaction time; visual analog scale; visual stimulation; Addiction; Attentional training; Craving; Food intake; Hunger; Incentive salience; Adolescent; Adult; Appetite; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Cues; Dietary Fats; Eating; Female; Humans; Hunger; Male; Motivation; Obesity; Overweight; Photic Stimulation; Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884707334

This paper assesses the potential suitability of attentional bias modification treatment (ABMT) for EDs as a way to target early automatic attentional processes and implicitly retune threat perception that happens outside of conscious control. Method We review data on anxiety in EDs, the neurobiological and behavioural relationship between anxiety disorders and EDs, attentional biases (AB) in EDs and the use of ABMT. Results Co-morbidities between EDs and anxiety disorders are common and negatively affect illness outcome. EDs and anxiety disorders share many underlying elements, including AB towards threatening and disorder-relevant stimuli. AB has been modified across a range of anxiety disorders using ABMT. It is possible to modify AB in EDs. Conclusion There is evidence to suggest that ABMT has potential as a targeted, rapid and convenient treatment option for EDs.

Despite growing interest, physiological determinants of AB are yet to be understood. We examined whether stress hormone cortisol and its diurnal variation pattern contribute to AB. Methods Eighty-seven healthy young adults underwent assessments for AB, anxious personality traits, depressive symptoms, and attentional function. Salivary cortisol was collected at three time points daily (at awakening, 30 min after awakening, and bedtime) for 2 consecutive days. We performed: (1) multiple regression analysis to examine the relationships between AB and the other measures and (2) analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups with different cortisol variation patterns for the other measures. Results Multiple regression analysis revealed that higher cortisol levels at bedtime (p&lt;0.001), an anxious personality trait (p=0.011), and years of education (p=0.036) were included in the optimal model to predict AB (adjusted R2=0.234, p&lt;0.001). ANOVA further demonstrated significant mean differences in AB and depressive symptoms; individuals with blunted cortisol variation exhibited significantly greater AB and depression than those with moderate variation (p=0.037 and p=0.009, respectively). Limitations Neuropsychological assessment focused on attention and cortisol measurement at three time points daily. Conclusions We showed that higher cortisol levels at bedtime and blunted cortisol variation are associated with greater AB. Individuals who have higher cortisol levels at diurnal trough might be at risk of clinical anxiety or depression but could also derive more benefits from the attentional-bias- modification program. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; Attention; Attentional bias; Cortisol; Diurnal variation; Personality","hydrocortisone; anxiety disorder; arousal; article; attention; circadian rhythm; cognition; depression; education; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human tissue; major clinical study; personality; priority journal; psychologic assessment; saliva level; Anxiety; Attention; Attentional bias; Cortisol; Diurnal variation; Personality; Adult; Anxiety; Attention; Circadian Rhythm; Depression; Fear; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Saliva; Young Adult","24683025, JSPS, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; 2012-6358","The authors thank all the participants and research assistants—Ms. Minami Katsumata, Ms. Hiroko Mizuno, and Mr. Takuya Hasegawa—who made the research possible.

Three experiments tested this idea by looking at the extent to which stimuli that had previously been experienced as predictive or nonpredictive in a categorization task were able to capture attention in a dot probe task. Consistent with certain attentional theories of learning, responses to the dot probe were faster when it appeared in a location cued by a predictive stimulus compared to a location cued by a nonpredictive stimulus. This result was obtained only with short (250-ms or 350-ms) but not long (1,000-ms) delays between onset of the stimuli and the dot probe, suggesting that the observed spatial cuing effect reflects the operation of a relatively rapid, automatic process.

Recent research has focused on the role of oxytocin in BPD, with mixed results as regards the processing of social stimuli. Methods: In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study, 13 BPD patients and 13 controls performed a dot probe task to examine attentional biases to happy and angry faces after intranasal application of oxytocin or placebo. Childhood trauma was examined using the childhood trauma questionnaire. Results: In the placebo condition, patients with BPD (but not controls) showed an avoidant reaction to angry faces (but not happy faces). The strength of the avoidant reaction correlated with the severity of childhood trauma. This behavioral response (as well as the correlation) was abolished in the oxytocin condition. Conclusions: Adult patients with BPD show an avoidant response to social threat, a reaction that is linked with traumatic experiences during childhood. This response pattern is altered by oxytocin, possibly by reducing stress and inhibiting social withdrawal from distressing social stimuli.

In currently depressed individuals without lung disease, depression-specific biases in information processing have been suggested as risk factors for the development and maintenance of depression. We examined whether comparable biases in cognitive information processing might underlie depression in COPD. Design Different aspects of cognitive information processing were examined with computer-based tasks measuring selective attention and memory in patients with COPD who were compared with age-matched, currently depressed patients without lung disease and healthy control participants. Methods The Self-Referential Encoding and Incidental Recall Task as well as the emotion face dot-probe task was applied to 21 never-depressed COPD patients, 18 currently depressed COPD patients, 20 currently depressed patients without lung disease and 19 healthy controls to examine cognitive biases. Results In both patients with COPD who were never and who were currently depressed, depression-like cognitive biases were observed for some attention- and memory-related tasks, but not for all tested aspects of information processing. These biases were particularly prominent in patients with COPD and current depression and comparable to those observed in currently depressed patients without lung disease. Conclusions The results of this pilot study suggest that patients with COPD may potentially show depression-like biases in some aspects of cognitive information processing. Future studies are required to examine whether these biases represent a vulnerability factor for the development of depression in patients with COPD. © 2013 The British Psychological Society.",,"aged; article; attention; case control study; chronic obstructive lung disease; cognition; depression; emotion; female; human; male; memory; middle aged; pilot study; psychological aspect; Aged; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881374120

Recognition memory for these stimuli was also analyzed in each species, using a recognition memory task in humans and a delayed non-matching-to-sample task in monkeys. We found that both humans and monkeys displayed a similar pattern of attentional biases toward threatening facial expressions of conspecifics. The bias was significant in monkeys and of marginal significance in humans. In addition, humans, but not monkeys, exhibited an attentional bias away from negative non-social images. Attentional biases for social and non-social threat differed significantly, with both species showing a pattern of vigilance toward negative social images and avoidance of negative non-social images. Positive stimuli did not elicit significant attentional biases for either species. In humans, emotional content facilitated the recognition of non-social images, but no effect of emotion was found for the recognition of social images. Recognition accuracy was not affected by emotion in monkeys, but response times were faster for negative relative to positive images. Altogether, these results suggest shared mechanisms of social attention in humans and monkeys, with both species showing a pattern of selective attention toward threatening faces of conspecifics. These data are consistent with the view that selective vigilance to social threat is the result of evolutionary constraints. Yet, selective attention to threat was weaker in humans than in monkeys, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms enable non-anxious humans to reduce sensitivity to social threat in this paradigm, likely through enhanced prefrontal control and reduced amygdala activation. In addition, the findings emphasize important differences in attentional biases to social versus non-social threat in both species. Differences in the impact of emotional stimuli on recognition memory between monkeys and humans will require further study, as methodological differences in the recognition tasks may have affected the results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Attention; Cognition; Emotion; Facial expressions; Macaque; Threat","Haplorhini; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; adolescent; animal; attention; emotion; facial expression; human; male; memory; photostimulation; psychology; recognition; rhesus monkey; young adult; Adolescent; Animals; Attention; Emotions; Facial Expression; Humans; Macaca mulatta; Male; Memory; Photic Stimulation; Recognition (Psychology); Young Adult",,"Acknowledgments This research was supported in part by a minigrant from the UMass College of Natural Sciences.

The sample comprised matched chronic pain (n = 24) and pain-free (n = 24) groups, each of which included lower and higher fear of pain subgroups. Participants completed a dot-probe task wherein eye movements were assessed during the presentation of sensory pain-neutral, health catastrophe-neutral, and neutral-neutral word pairs. Higher fear of pain levels were associated with biases in 1) directing initial gaze toward health catastrophe words and, among participants with chronic pain, 2) subsequent avoidance of threat as reflected by shorter first fixation durations on health catastrophe words compared to pain-free cohorts. As stimulus word pairs persisted for 2,000 ms, no group differences were observed for overall gaze durations or reaction times to probes that followed. In sum, this research identified specific biases in visual attention related to fear of pain and chronic pain during early stages of information processing that were not evident on the basis of later behavior responses to probes. Perspective Effects of chronic pain and fear of pain on attention were examined by tracking eye movements within a dot-probe paradigm. Heightened fear of pain corresponded to biases in initial gaze toward health catastrophe words and, among participants with chronic pain, subsequent gaze shifts away from these words.

Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000. ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention ""bias"" in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention; Bias; Eye-tracking; Social phobia","adult; aged; anger; article; attention; attention bias; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; DSM-IV; eye tracking; facial expression; fear; female; happiness; human; male; response time; social phobia; task performance; theoretical model; Attention; Bias; Eye-tracking; Social phobia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anger; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Case-Control Studies; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Eye Movements; Facial Expression; Female; Happiness; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phobic Disorders; Reaction Time; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884714292

Recent research has linked nonconscious attentional bias to threat with variability in the integrity of the amygdala - anterior cingulate pathway, which sheds light on the neuroanatomical basis for a behavioral precursor to anxiety. However, the extent to which structural variability in amygdala - anterior cingulate integrity relates to the functional connectivity within this pathway and how such functional connectivity may relate to attention bias behavior, remain critical missing pieces of the puzzle. In 15 individuals we measured the structural integrity of the amygdala - prefrontal pathway with diffusion tensor-weighted MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), amygdala-seeded intrinsic functional connectivity to the anterior cingulate, and attentional bias toward backward masked fearful faces with a dot-probe task. We found that greater biases in attention to threat predicted greater levels of uncinate fasciculus integrity, greater positive amygdala - anterior cingulate functional connectivity, and greater amygdala coupling with a broader social perception network including the superior temporal sulcus, tempoparietal junction (TPJ), and somatosensory cortex. Additionally, greater levels of uncinate fasciculus integrity correlated with greater levels of amygdala - anterior cingulate intrinsic functional connectivity. Thus, high bias individuals displayed a heightened degree of amygdala - anterior cingulate connectivity during basal conditions, which we believe predisposes these individuals to focus their attention on signals of threat within their environment. © 2013.","Awareness; Social perception; Superior temporal sulcus; Tempoparietal junction; Uncinate fasciculus","adult; amygdaloid nucleus; anterior cingulate; article; awareness; backward masking; diffusion tensor imaging; facial expression; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; normal human; somatosensory cortex; superior temporal sulcus; task performance; threat; uncinate fasciculus; Awareness; Social perception; Superior temporal sulcus; Tempoparietal junction; Uncinate fasciculus; Adult; Amygdala; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Social Perception; Young Adult","W911NF1110246, ARO, Army Research Office","Research was supported by Army Research Office grant W911NF1110246 (LRMP & JMC).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884814047

Only one study has shown reduced alcohol cravings following exercise but none have investigated the effects on attentional bias. The aim of the present study was to examine whether a single session of exercise reduces AB towards alcohol-related images and alcohol urges among high alcohol consumers. Methods The study involved 20 abstaining (for ≥3 days) alcohol drinkers, consuming more than weekly recommendations, with a mean age (SD) = 20.8 (0.8) years. Participants were initially randomised in a counterbalanced cross-over design to undertake either (1) 15 min of brisk walking or (2) 15 min of passive seating on different days. Participants completed an adapted dot probe task, with matched neutral and alcohol images randomly presented for either 200 ms or 1000 ms to respectively measure initial (IAB) or maintained attentional bias (MAB) pre- and post-treatment. The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) was administered before, immediately after, and 5 and 10 min post treatment. Results A two-way fully repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant condition × time interaction for MAB F(1, 17) = 6.96, p = 0.017, and AUQ scores F(1.47, 27.96) = 60.19, p < 0.001. MAB was significantly reduced following the exercise compared with the control condition. Differences in AUQ between conditions were significant at all assessments post treatment. Conclusions A short bout of exercise, compared with a passive control condition, may acutely reduce MAB to alcohol cues and alcohol urges, and thus may help with self-regulation of alcohol consumption. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a programme intended to train attention towards positive cues and a programme intended to train attention towards negative cues. In a randomised, controlled, double-blind design, the impact of these two training conditions on both selective attention and social anxiety were compared to that of a control training condition. A modified dot probe task was used, and delivered via the internet. A total of 129 individuals, diagnosed with SAD, were randomly assigned to one of these three conditions and took part in a 14-day programme with daily training/control sessions. Participants in all three groups did not on average display an attentional bias prior to the training. Critically, results on change in attention bias implied that significantly differential change in selective attention to threat was not detected in the three conditions. However, symptoms of social anxiety reduced significantly from pre- to follow-up-assessment in all three conditions (dwithin = 0.63-1.24), with the procedure intended to train attention towards threat cues producing, relative to the control condition, a significantly greater reduction of social fears. There were no significant differences in social anxiety outcome between the training condition intended to induce attentional bias towards positive cues and the control condition. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT where a condition intended to induce attention bias to negative cues yielded greater emotional benefits than a control condition. Intriguingly, changes in symptoms are unlikely to be by the mechanism of change in attention processes since there was no change detected in bias per se. Implications of this finding for future research on attention bias modification in social anxiety are discussed.

Eight participants with chronic pain completed eight ABM sessions, which featured a modified version of the visual-probe task implicitly training attention away from pain-related stimuli towards neutral stimuli. Training sessions included a variety of linguistic and pictorial pain-related stimuli, which were presented at two presentation times (500 and 1250 ms). Participants also completed a standard version of the visual-probe task pre- and post-ABM to assess changes in bias. The primary outcome measure was pain intensity, and secondary outcome measures were anxiety, depression severity and pain interference. Statistically and clinically significant change was shown pre- to post-ABM in pain intensity, anxiety, depression and pain interference. Attentional bias scores did not statistically differ across time. These results support the continued exploration of ABM in chronic pain and the modifications we made to the intervention (i.e. the inclusion of pictorial stimuli and a longer presentation time).

The ethologist Konrad Lorenz proposed that the infantile features of mammals and birds, known as the baby schema (kindchenschema), motivate caretaking behaviour. As biologically relevant stimuli, newborns are likely to be processed specially in terms of visual attention, perception, and cognition. Recent demonstrations on human participants have shown visual attentional prioritisation to newborn faces (i.e., newborn faces capture visual attention). Although characteristics equivalent to those found in the faces of human infants are found in nonhuman primates, attentional capture by newborn faces has not been tested in nonhuman primates. We examined whether conspecific newborn faces captured the visual attention of two Japanese monkeys using a target-detection task based on dot-probe tasks commonly used in human visual attention studies. Although visual cues enhanced target detection in subject monkeys, our results, unlike those for humans, showed no evidence of an attentional prioritisation for newborn faces by monkeys. Our demonstrations showed the validity of dot-probe task for visual attention studies in monkeys and propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between human and nonhuman primate social cognition research. This suggests that attentional capture by newborn faces is not common to macaques, but it is unclear if nursing experiences influence their perception and recognition of infantile appraisal stimuli.

There is evidence, in a dot probe paradigm, that individuals with chronic pain selectively orient their attention toward pain-related stimuli, but no studies have differentiated between the two attentional processes of hypervigilance that are evident in athletes: facilitated detection of threat and difficulty in disengaging attention from threatening stimuli. In the present study using a dot probe paradigm, we examined whether professional rugby players (N=58) with high pain-related anxiety (HPA) would show an attentional bias for pain-related threat, and whether this hypervigilance would reflect difficulty disengaging from threat or facilitated detection of threat. Rugby players with HPA oriented their attention toward pain-related threat with a concomitant difficulty disengaging from threat. Difficulty disengaging from painful stimuli may increase anxiety, and thus be maladaptive in sport.

A modified dot-probe task using idiographically selected health-threat words was administered to an undergraduate sample. Self-report measures were administered to assess somatic, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of health anxiety, in addition to assessing negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, and experience of actual medical conditions. Results showed that behavioral and somatic aspects of health anxiety were significantly associated with AB toward personally relevant threat words, even after controlling for negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, and experience of actual medical conditions. Additional analyses revealed that these biases reflected difficulty disengaging attention from threat rather than a facilitated detection of threat.

However, it is unknown how IN-OT modulates social cognition, its effect after repeated use, or its impact on the developing brain. Animal models are urgently needed. This study examined the effect of IN-OT on social perception in monkeys using tasks that reveal some of the social impairments seen in autism. Six rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta, 4 males) received a 48. IU dose of OT or saline placebo using a pediatric nebulizer. An hour later, they performed a computerized task (the dot-probe task) to measure their attentional bias to social, emotional, and nonsocial images. Results showed that IN-OT significantly reduced monkeys' attention to negative facial expressions, but not neutral faces or clip art images and, additionally, showed a trend to enhance monkeys' attention to direct vs. averted gaze faces. This study is the first to demonstrate an effect of IN-OT on social perception in monkeys, IN-OT selectively reduced monkey's attention to negative facial expressions, but not neutral social or nonsocial images. These findings complement several reports in humans showing that IN-OT reduces the aversive quality of social images suggesting that, like humans, monkey social perception is mediated by the oxytocinergic system. Importantly, these results in monkeys suggest that IN-OT does not dampen the emotional salience of social stimuli, but rather acts to affect the evaluation of emotional images during the early stages of information processing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention; Autism; Facial expression; Gaze; Oxytocin; Social cognition","oxytocin; placebo; animal experiment; article; aversion; controlled study; drug effect; emotionality; facial expression; female; gaze; hormone action; male; mental performance; nonhuman; perception; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; rhesus monkey; selective attention; social cognition; stimulus response; task performance; visual stimulation; Attention; Autism; Facial expression; Gaze; Oxytocin; Social cognition; Administration, Intranasal; Aerosols; Animals; Attention; Emotions; Equipment Design; Facial Expression; Female; Macaca mulatta; Male; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Oxytocin; Social Perception; Species Specificity","Programs/OD P51OD011132; Emory University; MHR01068791, NIH, National Institutes of Health; Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center; P51RR000165, NCRR, National Center for Research Resources","This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health , MHR01068791 to L.A.

We hypothesized that the auditory effect on VSWM would depend on the perceptual association between the auditory cue and the visual probe. Results showed, for the first time, a significant auditory attentional bias in VSWM.

Attentional bias is a cognitive intermediate in the conditioned association between drug-related cues, craving, and relapse. Numerous studies have documented the existence of attentional bias for cues associated with substances. By contrast, few studies have investigated attentional bias in individuals with pathological gambling (PG) or problematic gambling. In this study, we sought to assess attentional bias at the level of maintenance of attention in a sample of pathological gamblers. Twenty-three pathological gamblers and 21 healthy volunteers performed the Visual Probe Task to compare attentional bias with gambling-related cues between individuals with PG and healthy volunteers. The measured of attentional bias was based on their reaction times (RTs) to probes replacing neutral and gambling-related cues (images). Second, we examined the correlation between PG severity and degree of attentional bias among individuals with PG. Results show that pathological gamblers, but not healthy volunteers, had attentional bias for gambling-related cues with exposure times that assess maintenance of attention. There was no correlation between PG severity and degree of attentional bias.

While some have argued that these biases function to predispose and/or act to maintain disordered eating behaviours, evidence supporting this view has rarely been examined. This report summarises and integrates the existing literature on AB in EDs and other related psychiatric disorders to better understand its potential role in the development and maintenance of an ED. The domains reviewed include experimental data using the dot-probe and modified Stroop task and neurobiological findings on AB in women with EDs as well as the role of AB in current theoretical models.

The prevalence of anxiety disorders in the older cohort is growing, and there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to suspect that age-related factors could moderate attentional bias effects in the context of late-life anxiety. The current study included one of the most widely-used measures of attentional bias, the dot-probe task (Mathews & MacLeod, 1985). Participants were older adults who were either nonanxious or diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. The patient subsample also completed cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or an equivalent wait list condition, after which the dot probe was administered a second time. Results showed that clinical anxiety had no particular importance for the deployment of attention, casting doubt on the universality of biased attention in older anxiety patients. Although there were no maladaptive biases detected toward either threat or depression words at pretreatment, there was nevertheless a marginally significant differential reduction in bias toward threat words following CBT.

Selective attention to pain-related stimuli, known as pain attentional bias (AB), can exacerbate chronic pain, prolong suffering, and undermine quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine if a multimodal mindfulness-oriented intervention could significantly reduce pain AB among chronic pain patients receiving opioid analgesics. Methods: A total of 67 chronic pain patients were randomized to an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention or a social support group intervention and began treatment. A dot probe task was used to measure pain AB. Primary outcomes were pain AB scores for cues presented for 2,000 and 200 ms. Results: Prior to intervention, participants exhibited a significant bias towards pain-related cues presented for 2,000 ms, but no bias for cues presented for 200 ms. A statistically significant time × intervention condition interaction was observed for 2,000 ms pain AB, such that participants in MORE evidenced significantly reduced posttreatment pain AB relative to pretreatment levels, whereas no significant pre-post treatment changes in pain AB were observed for support group participants. Decreases in pain AB were associated with increased perceived control over pain and attenuated reactivity to distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusion: Study findings provide the first indication that a mindfulness-oriented intervention may reduce pain AB among adults suffering from chronic pain. Given the magnitude of chronic pain in postindustrial societies, coupled with the dramatic escalation in prescription opioid misuse, future studies should evaluate MORE as a nonpharmacological means of addressing factors linked with chronic pain. © 2013 S.

The reasons for this are poorly understood, and there has been little research investigating the cognitive correlates of anxiety in individuals with ASD. Typically developing youth with anxiety disorders have frequently been found to show an attentional bias toward threatening information. In this study, we examined whether such a bias was also found in young people with ASD and anxiety symptoms. The protocol utilized two versions of the dot-probe paradigm, the first with emotional faces and the second with emotional words. Participants comprised 38 boys with an ASD and 41 typically developing controls aged 10-16 years of age. Those with an ASD displayed higher levels of parent- and child-rated anxiety (both P<0.001) and depression (P<0.001) compared with controls. However, there were no significant group differences in attentional bias scores and no significant relationship between anxiety and attentional bias in either the face or word tasks, for either group. Our findings suggest that, for young people with ASD, unlike non-ASD individuals with an anxiety disorder, high levels of anxiety may not be associated with attentional bias to threat. This may indicate that anxiety in ASD has different cognitive correlates from anxiety in the typically developing population.

However, the cognitive mechanisms responsible for these attentional biases remain largely unknown. Further, the authors outline the need to consider the nature of the attentional processes in operation (hypervigilance, avoidance, or disengagement). We adapted a dot-probe paradigm to record behavioral and electrophysiological responses in 26 participants reporting high or low fear of evaluation, a major component of social anxiety. Pairs of faces including a neutral and an emotional face (displaying anger, fear, disgust, or happiness) were presented during 200. ms and then replaced by a neutral target to discriminate. Results show that anxious participants were characterized by an increased P1 in response to pairs of faces, irrespective of the emotional expression included in the pair. They also showed an increased P2 in response to angry-neutral pairs selectively. Finally, in anxious participants, the P1 response to targets was enhanced when replacing emotional faces, whereas non-anxious subjects showed no difference between the two conditions. These results indicate an early hypervigilance to face stimuli in social anxiety, coupled with difficulty in disengaging from threat and sustained attention to emotional stimuli.

Questions remain regarding the cognitive mechanisms that may help elucidate the observed links between EEG asymmetry and patterns of socioemotional functioning. The current study observed frontal EEG asymmetry patterns at rest and under social threat among young adults (N= 45, M= 21.1. years). Asymmetries were, in turn, associated with performance on an emotion-face dot-probe attention bias task. Attention biases to threat have been implicated as potential causal mechanisms in anxiety and social withdrawal. Frontal EEG asymmetry at baseline did not predict attention bias patterns to angry or happy faces. However, increases in right frontal alpha asymmetry from baseline to the stressful speech condition were associated with vigilance to angry faces and avoidance of happy faces. The findings may reflect individual differences in the pattern of response (approach or withdrawal) with the introduction of a mild stressor. Comparison analyses with frontal beta asymmetry and parietal alpha asymmetry did not find similar patterns. Thus, the data may reflect the unique role of frontal regions, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in cognitive control and threat detection, coupled with ruminative processes associated with alpha activity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Attention bias; EEG asymmetry; Speech task","adult; alpha rhythm; anxiety; article; attention; beta rhythm; brain asymmetry; brain function; cognition; electroencephalogram; emotion; facial expression; female; human; male; nerve stimulation; nervous system parameters; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; psychosocial withdrawal; speech; stress; Attention bias; EEG asymmetry; Speech task; Adult; Alpha Rhythm; Attention; Cerebral Cortex; Choice Behavior; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health; MH073569; MH094633","Support for study preparation was provided by National Instituteof Mental Health grants MH073569 and MH094633 to Koraly Perez-Edgar.

The aim of the present study was to determine the existence and nature of an attention bias for food cues in healthy-weight female restrained and unrestrained eaters, when matching the two groups on BMI. Method: Attention biases for food cues were measured by recordings of eye movements during a visual probe task with pictorial food versus non-food stimuli. Healthy weight high restrained (n=. 24) and low restrained eaters (n=. 21) were matched on BMI in an attempt to unconfound the effects of restraint and weight on attention allocation patterns. Results: All participants showed elevated attention biases for food stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli, independent of restraint status.

According to Attention Restoration Theory (ART) the restorative potential of natural environments is situated in the fact that nature can replenish depleted attentional resources. This replenishment takes place, in part, because nature is deemed to be a source of fascination, with fascination being described as having an ""attentional"", an ""affective"" and an ""effort"" dimension. However, the claim that fascination with nature involves these three dimensions is to a large extent based on intuition or derived from introspection-based measurement methods, such as self-reports. In three studies, we aimed to more objectively assess whether these three dimensions indeed applied to experiences related to natural environments, before any (attentional) depletion has taken place. The instruments that were used were: (a) the affect misattribution procedure (Study 1), (b) the dot probe paradigm (Study 2) and (c) a cognitively effortful task (Study 3). These instrument were respectively aimed at verifying the affective, attentional and effort dimension of fascination. Overall, the results provide objective evidence for the claims made within the ART framework, that natural as opposed to urban settings are affectively positive (cfr., affective dimension) and that people have an attentional bias to natural (rather than urban) environments (cfr., attentional dimension). The results regarding the effort dimension are less straightforward, and suggest that this dimension only becomes important in sufficiently difficult cognitive tasks. © 2013 Joye et al.",,"analytic method; article; attention; cognition; human; mental stress; mood; natural science; psychological aspect; psychology; urban area; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Nature; Photic Stimulation; Psychology; Task Performance and Analysis; Wilderness; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880802005

This study examined the effect of health threat on attentional bias for negative health words. Methods Participants completed questionnaires and were then randomized to receive either threatening or reassuring health-related feedback. Following randomization, participants completed the emotional Stroop and dot-probe tasks in a counter-balanced order. Results On the emotional Stroop task, all participants took longer to name the colour of negative words, as compared to positive and neutral words. However on the dot probe task, differences in attentional bias emerged based on feedback condition. Those receiving reassuring feedback displayed a bias away from negative words while those receiving threatening feedback did not display a bias either towards or away from negative words. Following reassuring feedback only, metacognitions were negatively correlated with attention towards positive health-related stimuli, suggesting another avenue for future research. Conclusions Health threats lead to an increase in the processing of negative information, and the effect of metacognitions on processing appears to be apparent only in the absence of health threat. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, to date, no study has examined the adaptation of this attention bias modification procedure into a single-case design for social phobia. Using an attention training procedure based on a modified dot-probe task, the present single-case study examined whether such procedure enabled a client with a social phobia to reduce attentional biases and to transfer this rehabilitation on anxiety response to a speech performance, social anxiety symptoms severity, and diagnosis of social phobia. Using a Bayesian probabilistic approach, case's performances were compared to a normative sample before, after the treatment, at a 2-month follow-up, at a 6-month follow-up, as well as one year after the treatment. The results suggested the efficacy of the rehabilitation program on the attentional bias for threat cues and the generalization of these beneficial effects to decrease in anxiety symptoms during the 2-and 6-month follow-up period.

Nevertheless, attention bias modification (ABM) research has rarely utilized sub-awareness protocols in an attempt to modify attention patterns and reduce anxiety. Exploring the potential of subliminal ABM is of interest, as it may target attention processes related to anxiety that are distinct from those engaged by supraliminal ABM. Here we examined the effect of a subliminal ABM training protocol on levels of social anxiety and stress vulnerability. Fifty-one socially anxious students were randomly assigned to either ABM or placebo condition, and completed a pre-training assessment, four training sessions, a social stressor task, and a post-training assessment. Results indicate that the subliminal ABM used here did not induce detectable changes in threat-related attention from pre-to post-training as measured by two independent attention tasks. Furthermore, the ABM and placebo groups did not differ on either self-reported social anxiety post-training or state anxiety following stress induction. Post-hoc auxiliary analyses suggest that ABM may be associated with smaller elevations in state anxiety during the stressor task only for participants who demonstrate attention bias toward threat at baseline.

Individuals with chronic headache, compared with healthy controls, were hypothesized to show significant attentional bias towards disorder-relevant headache-related images. METHODS: Individuals with chronic headache (n=37) and headache-free controls (n=38) completed a visual-probe task with headache-related, pain-related, health-threat, and general-threat pictorial stimuli, which were presented at 500 and 1250 ms exposure durations. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic headache, compared with headache-free controls, demonstrated significant bias towards headache-related images presented for 1250 ms. Considering participant groups separately, the chronic headache group showed bias towards headache-related images at 500 and 1250 ms, and pain-related images at 500 ms. The control group showed bias towards general-threat images at 500 ms. DISCUSSION: Individuals with chronic headache demonstrate attentional bias towards pain information, which is most prominently shown towards stimuli relevant to their specific disorder. Biases are also more pronounced at longer stimuli presentation times associated with maintained attention. Future research should investigate the clinical implications of attentional bias in chronic headache, and further explore the benefits of attentional bias modification upon patient functioning.

Prior work has found that rumination predicts many forms of psychopathology including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, self-injury, and especially depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008). In the present study, we attempt to characterize the ruminative process in real time in young adolescents, specifically by examining factors that predict rumination following an interpersonal stressor. A community sample of 105 youth ages 9 to 14 (70% girls; 66% Caucasian) completed questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms and trait rumination along with an assessment of selective attention using an emotional faces dot-probe task. Participants then underwent an interpersonal stressor and audio rumination induction in the laboratory during which time thoughts were sampled regularly and coded. Results indicate that negative self-referential thought is a common response to the stressor and is predicted by trait rumination scores. Although most participants were able to disengage from this type of thinking, 10.5% persisted through (i.e., ruminated) until the end of the study. These individuals were characterized by higher depressive symptoms and an attentional bias away from happy (relative to neutral) faces. Differences in attentional processes may characterize rumination in youth. Implications for the measurement of rumination as well as treatment are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"adolescent; anxiety; article; attention; child; child psychology; cognition; depression; emotion; female; human; male; mental stress; psychological aspect; questionnaire; self report; thinking; Adolescent; Adolescent Psychology; Anxiety; Attention; Child; Cognition; Depression; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Self Report; Stress, Psychological; Thinking","T32-MH018931-21, SDP, Smithsonian Scientific Diving Program; R01-MH061285, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health","Lori Hilt is now at Lawrence University in Appleton, WI.

For it, in this study the aim was to verify the presence of visual attentional biases using the dot probe task in university smokers, stage where the smoking habit is consolidated. The sample was constituted by 337 students of the University of Huelva, with ages between 17 and 30 years.

More recent evidence has also found attentional biases for stimuli that are relevant to the current and temporary goals of an individual. We examined whether goal-relevant information still evokes an attentional bias when this information competes with threatening events. In three experiments, participants performed a dot probe task combined with a separate task that induced a temporary goal. The results of Experiment 1 showed that attention was oriented to goal-relevant pictures in the dot probe task when these pictures were simultaneously presented with neutral or threatening pictures. Whether goal-relevant pictures themselves were threatening or neutral did not influence the results. Experiment 2 replicated these findings in a sample of highly trait-anxious participants. Experiment 3 showed that attention was automatically deployed to stimuli relevant to a temporary goal even in the presence of stimuli that signal imminent and genuine threat (i.e., a colored patch signaling the presentation of an aversive noise).

Forty-two individuals completed the study (PI = 21; NS = 21). Participants completed a dot-probe task with stimuli comprising insomnia-specific (fatigue/malaise) and neutral pictures. It was hypothesized that individuals with PI would show greater attentional bias to insomnia-specific stimuli compared with NS. An overall bias effect was noted. This effect was however not due to vigilance; taking into account the reaction times on neutral trials, the PI group and the NS group did not display significantly different results in reaction times to insomnia-specific pictures. On the contrary, the results suggest that the overall bias effect was due to disengagement; the PI group had significantly longer reaction times than the NS group when shifting away from the insomnia-specific pictures, relative to neutral-neutral picture presentations.

Cognitive biases for threat information are considered a robust characteristic of childhood anxiety. However, little is known regarding the underlying aetiology of such biases and their role in anxiety disorders. Method: A face version of the dot-probe task measuring attentional biases for negative (anger, fear, sad, disgust) and positive (happy) facial expressions was completed by 600, 8-year-old twins; the largest study of its kind. Twin correlations for attentional bias scores were compared to estimate genetic and environmental effects. Parent-report diagnostic interviews identified children with an anxiety disorder. Indices of inferred genetic and familial risk for anxiety disorders were created for each child. Data were analysed using a series of logistic regressions. Results: Anxious children showed greater attentional avoidance of negative faces than nonanxious children; t (548) = 2.55, p <.05. Attentional avoidance was not under genetic or shared environmental influence. Risk for anxiety disorders was predicted by familial factors. Both attentional avoidance and inferred familial risk were significant but independent predictors of anxiety disorders (ORs =.65 and 3.64, respectively). Conclusions: Anxiety-related attentional biases and familial risk play important but independent roles in childhood anxiety disorders. If replicated, these findings indicate that links between genetic risk and anxiety disorders lie outside the domain of attentional processes. © 2012 The Authors.","Anxiety; attention; children; familial risk","anxiety disorder; article; attention; child; color vision; emotion; facial expression; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype environment interaction; harm reduction; human; male; orientation; pattern recognition; psychological aspect; reaction time; receptive field; twins; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Child; Color Perception; Diseases in Twins; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Field Dependence-Independence; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Harm Reduction; Humans; Male; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878108444

Second, using a visual probe task, two studies tested whether self-threatening USC results in withdrawing attention from peripheral elements of the task (attentional focusing) or potentiation of prepotent responses (mere effort). Results support the attentional focusing hypothesis: USC resulted in less attention being devoted to a peripheral element, even though typically associated with prepotent responses. Moreover, and in contradiction with a mere effort account, findings did not show a general decrease in response latencies (Study 2). This attentional focusing nevertheless only occurred when the task was self-threatening (i.e., presented as a measure of intellectual ability).

Although it has been a long-held view that psychopharmacological approaches work by directly targeting automatic emotional information processing in the brain, it is usually postulated that psychological treatments affect these processes only over time, through changes in more conscious thought cycles. This study explored the role of early changes in emotional information processing in CBT action. Methods: Twenty-eight untreated patients with panic disorder were randomized to a single session of exposure-based CBT or waiting group. Emotional information processing was measured on the day after intervention with an attentional visual probe task, and clinical symptoms were assessed on the day after intervention and at 4-week follow-up. Results: Vigilance for threat information was decreased in the treated group, compared with the waiting group, the day after intervention, before reductions in clinical symptoms. The magnitude of this early effect on threat vigilance predicted therapeutic response after 4 weeks. Conclusions: Cognitive behavioral therapy rapidly affects automatic processing, and these early effects are predictive of later therapeutic change. Such results suggest very fast action on automatic processes mediating threat sensitivity, and they provide an early marker of treatment response. Furthermore, these findings challenge the notion that psychological treatments work directly on conscious thought processes before automatic information processing and imply a greater similarity between early effects of pharmacological and psychological treatments for anxiety than previously thought. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Antidepressants; anxiety; cognitive-behavior therapy; emotional information processing; mechanisms of action; panic disorder","adult; agoraphobia; alertness; anxiety; article; clinical article; cognitive therapy; disease severity; education; exercise test; female; human; information processing; intelligence quotient; male; nerve cell plasticity; panic; priority journal; response time; safety; threat; treatment response; visual analog scale; Adult; Arousal; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Emotions; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Panic Disorder; Photic Stimulation; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877582075

PTSD has a well-known proximate cause, commonly occurring after a life-threatening event that induces a response of intense fear, horror, and helplessness. Much of the advancement in understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD has emerged from conceptualizing the disorder as one that involves substantial dysfunction in fear processing. This article reviews recent knowledge of fear processing markers in PTSD. A systematic search was performed of reports within the specific three-year publication time period of January 2010 to December 2012. We identified a total of 31 studies reporting fear processing markers in PTSD. We further categorized them according to the following classification: (1) neural-activation markers (n=10), (2) psychophysiological markers (n=14), and (3) behavioral markers (n=7).

GSK424887 is a selective competitive antagonist of the human NK 1 receptor and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter. However, its actions in human models of depression have not been assessed. Methods: This study explored the effects of acute administration of GSK424887 compared to placebo in healthy male volunteers. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram was used as a positive control. A battery of emotional processing tasks was given at the peak time of drug effect. Results: GSK424887 enhanced attentional vigilance in the dot-probe task to both positive and negative stimuli. By contrast, citalopram enhanced perception of angry, sad and happy facial expressions and increased positive bias in the facial expression recognition task. Neither drug significantly affected emotion potentiated startle responses or emotional memory. Conclusions: These results suggest that acute administration of GSK424887 modulated some aspects of emotional processing but these effects were not similar to those seen previously with antidepressant agents. This was the first use of the battery of emotional processing tasks in a Phase 1 study.

Learning to attend to threats is vital for survival and thus may involve faster memory consolidation than simple procedural learning. Here, we tested whether attention to threat modulates the time-course and magnitude of learning and memory consolidation effects associated with skill practice. All participants (N = 90) practiced in two sessions on a dot-probe task featuring pairs of neutral and angry faces followed by target probes which were to be discriminated as rapidly as possible. In the attend-threat training condition, targets always appeared at the angry face location, forming an association between threat and target location; target location was unrelated to valence in a control training condition. Within each attention training condition, duration of the between-session rest interval was varied to establish the time-course for emergence of consolidation effects. During the first practice session, we observed robust improvement in task performance (online, within-session gains), followed by saturation of learning. Both training conditions exhibited similar overall learning capacities, but performance in the attend-threat condition was characterized by a faster learning rate relative to control. Consistent with the memory consolidation hypothesis, between-session performance gains (delayed gains) were observed only following a rest interval. However, rest intervals of 1 and 24 hours yielded similar delayed gains, suggesting accelerated consolidation processes.

Eleven healthy adults performed a visual discrimination task during cyclical concealed hand movements underneath a display.

The standard view is that this enhancement generalizes across visual properties of a stimulus. We test whether the size of an exogenous cue sets the attentional field and whether this leads to different effects on stimuli with different visual properties. In a dual task with a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) in each quadrant of the screen, participants discriminated the direction of moving dots in one RDK and localized one red dot. Precues were uninformative and consisted of either a large or a small luminance-change frame. The motion discrimination task showed attentional effects following both large and small exogenous cues. The red dot probe localization task showed attentional effects following a small cue, but not a large cue. Two additional experiments showed that the different effects on localization were not due to reduced spatial uncertainty or suppression of RDK dots in the surround. These results indicate that the effects of exogenous attention depend on the size of the cue and the properties of the task, suggesting the involvement of receptive fields with different sizes in different tasks. These attentional effects are likely to be driven by bottom-up mechanisms in early visual areas. © 2013 © 2013 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Exogenous cue; Spatial attention","association; attention; depth perception; female; human; male; movement perception; perception; perceptive discrimination; photostimulation; physiology; psychophysics; reaction time; student; university; Attention; Cues; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Psychophysics; Reaction Time; Size Perception; Space Perception; Students; Universities",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890801633

Design A visual dot probe task was utilised, with the warnings serving as critical stimuli that were manipulated for the presence of graphic versus neutral image content, and the accompanying text caption. This mixed design yielded image content (graphic versus neutrally-matched images) and presence (versus absence) of text caption as within subjects variables and smoking status as a between-participants variable. Setting The experiment took place within the laboratories of a UK university. Participants Eighty-six psychology undergraduates (51% smokers, 69% female), predominantly of Caucasian ethnicity took part. Measurements Reaction times towards probes replacing graphic images relative to probes replacing neutral images were utilised to create an index of attentional bias. Findings Bias scores (M = 10.20 ± 2.56) highlighted that the graphic image content of the warnings elicited attentional biases (relative to neutral images) for smokers. This only occurred in the presence of an accompanying text caption [t (43) = 3.950, P < 0.001] as opposed to when no caption was present [t (43) = 0.029, P = 0.977].

However, major questions exist concerning diagnostic specificity, effects of symptom-severity levels, and threat-stimulus exposure durations in attention paradigms. This study examines these issues in a large, community school-based sample. Method A total of 2046 children (ages 6-12 years) were assessed using the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA), Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and dot-probe tasks. Children were classified based on presence or absence of 'fear-related' disorders, 'distress-related' disorders, and behavioural disorders. Two dot-probe tasks, which differed in stimulus exposure, assessed attention biases for happy-face and threat-face cues. The main analysis included 1774 children. Results For attention bias scores, a three-way interaction emerged among face-cue emotional valence, diagnostic group, and internalizing symptom severity (FÂ =Â 2.87, pÂ <Â 0.05). This interaction reflected different associations between internalizing symptom severity and threat-related attention bias across diagnostic groups. In children with no diagnosis (nÂ =Â 1411, mean differenceÂ =Â 11.03, s.e.Â =Â 3.47, dfÂ =Â 1, pÂ <Â 0.001) and those with distress-related disorders (nÂ =Â 66, mean differenceÂ =Â 10.63, s.e.Â =Â 5.24, dfÂ =Â 1, pÂ <Â 0.05), high internalizing symptoms predicted vigilance towards threat. However, in children with fear-related disorders (nÂ =Â 86, mean differenceÂ =Â -11.90, s.e.Â =Â 5.94, dfÂ =Â 1, pÂ <Â 0.05), high internalizing symptoms predicted an opposite tendency, manifesting as greater bias away from threat. These associations did not emerge in the behaviour-disorder group (nÂ =Â 211). Conclusions The association between internalizing symptoms and biased orienting varies with the nature of developmental psychopathology. Both the form and severity of psychopathology moderates threat-related attention biases in children.

In both experiments, participants were encouraged to attend to either affective stimulus information (affective groups) or non-affective semantic stimulus information (non-affective groups). In both experiments, an attentional bias towards negative stimuli was found in the affective groups but not in the non-affective groups. In Experiment 1, we also observed an attentional bias towards non-affective semantic stimulus information in the non-affective group but not in the affective groups. We argue that these effects are due to a modulation of automatic stimulus processing by feature-specific attention allocation. Our data demonstrate that automatic attentional biases toward negative stimuli are not unconditional but instead depend on the relevance of negative information.

Forty-one undergraduates (19 socially anxious; 22 non-anxious controls) completed a dot-probe task with emotional (happy and disgust) and neutral facial expressions and a concurrent n-back task.

They found that training anxious individuals to attend to nonthreat stimuli reduces AB, which, in turn, reduces anxiety. This effect supports the hypothesis that AB can causally impact the maintenance of anxiety. At a fundamental level, however, uncertainty still abounds regarding the nature of the processes that mediate this effect. In the present paper, we propose that two contrasting approaches may be derived from theoretical accounts of AB. According to a first class of models, called the ""valence-specific bias"" models, modifying AB requires the modification of valence-specific attentional selectivity. According to a second class of models, called the ""attention control models"", modifying AB requires the modification of attention control, driven by the recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We formulate a series of specific predictions, to provide suggestions to trial these two approaches one against the other. This knowledge is critical for understanding the mechanisms of AB in anxiety disorders, which bares important clinical implications. © 2013 Heeren, De_raedt, Koster and Philippot.","Affective neuroscience; Attentional bias; Cognitive bias modification; DLPFC; Experimental psychopathology; Neuromodulation","anxiety disorder; article; attention; attention bias; attention control model; behavior control; brain cortex; cognition; event related potential; human; motivation; neuromodulation; prefrontal cortex; valence specific model",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875530969

Early and late stages of processing, with shifts from attentional engagement to disengagement (avoidance), have been identified, but rarely investigated in the same protocol. Therefore, the present study aimed to consider 2 time frames that might be indicative of attentional engagement and disengagement. One hundred pain-free individuals performed a modified dot-probe task with pictorial stimuli displaying affective facial expressions (ie, pain, anger, joy, neutral face), presented either for 100 ms or for 500 ms. Because fear of pain has been found to moderate attentional processing of pain stimuli, the Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ III) was also administered. Results indicated both early attentional engagement and later disengagement (avoidance) for negative facial expressions (anger, pain). This pattern was most prominent for pain faces and among those participants high in pain-related fear. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that the dot-probe task is suitable to investigate different stages of attentional processing for pain-related stimuli. In accordance with the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis, pain-related stimuli seem to attract attention quickly, but attentional avoidance may occur shortly after. Perspective: We focused on different stages of attentional processing of pain faces in pain-free individuals. Results highlight the importance of distinguishing between early (engagement) and later (disengagement) components of attention, as well as considering the role that fear of pain has in understanding the nature of these effects. © 2013 by the American Pain Society.","Attentional bias; dot-probe task; facial expressions of pain; fear of pain","adult; aged; anger; article; attention; avoidance behavior; clinical article; facial expression; female; human; male; pain; stimulus response; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Emotions; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Photic Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875214788

Given that, in general, subjective craving is positively associated with attentional bias, we predicted that attentional biases in abstinent alcoholics would depend on their level of alcohol craving. In the present study 28 alcoholic patients, who had recently commenced a day treatment program, and 26 social drinking controls completed an alcohol Stroop task, a visual probe task with three stimulus durations (200, 500, and 2,000 ms), and self-report assessments of craving and alcohol dependence. On the alcohol Stroop task, abstinent alcoholics showed a greater interference effect for alcohol-related than neutral words, relative to social drinkers. On the visual probe task, alcoholic patients who reported a high level of craving exhibited a greater attentional bias toward alcohol cues, relative to both patients reporting a low level of craving, and social drinker controls. Alcoholics who reported low levels of craving showed avoidance of alcohol cues at 500 ms, relative to social drinkers. Among alcoholics, early dropout from treatment was associated with the severity of alcohol dependence and the strength of subjective craving, but it was not associated with measures of attentional bias.

For the current study, 20 heavy drinkers and 20 moderate drinkers completed a visual probe task in response to placebo and two active doses of alcohol (0.45g/kg and 0.65g/kg). Participants' eye-movements were monitored and attentional bias was calculated as the difference in time spent focused on alcohol compared to neutral images. Participants' alcohol consumption was assessed by a timeline follow-back calendar and a laboratory ad lib consumption task. Results showed that heavy drinkers displayed significantly greater attentional bias than did moderate drinkers following placebo. However, heavy drinkers displayed a dose-dependent decrease in attentional bias following alcohol, whereas the drug had no effect in moderate drinkers. Individual differences in attentional bias under placebo were strongly associated with both self-reported and laboratory alcohol consumption, yet bias following alcohol administration did not predict either measure of consumption. These findings suggest that attentional bias is strongest before a drinking episode begins. As such, an attentional bias might be most influential in terms of initiation of alcohol consumption, and less of a factor in promoting continued consumption within the drinking episode. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","alcohol; attentional bias; heavy drinkers","alcohol; adult; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; article; attentional bias; behavior change; binge drinking; blood sampling; controlled study; coping behavior; drinking behavior; eye movement; female; human; male; participant observation; prediction; self report; stimulus response; systematic error; task performance; visual stimulation; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Attention; Cues; Ethanol; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880550307

The current study extends this work by mapping the neural correlates of experimentally-induced changes in attention bias. The study examines both behavioral and psychophysiological changes associated with experimentally- induced changes in threat bias. Methods: Thirty-four non-anxious female adults were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: training attention toward threat or placebo control. Attention bias was assessed and trained via a modified dot-probe task. Participants completed pre- and post-training assessments of attention bias and stress reactivity. As well, EEG was collected during pre- and post-test assessment of attention bias using the dot-probe task. Results: Training induced significant changes in attention bias, though findings were complicated by group differences in baseline threat-bias scores. Compared to controls, those in the training group showed greater depression vulnerability to a post-training stressor and increased P2 amplitude, an ERP component associated with attention toward threat, during the dot-probe task. Limitations: Although participants were randomly assigned to groups, there were still group differences in pre-training bias scores. Also, while the use of a stress task before the initial assessment of attention bias was used to control for initial differences in stress vulnerability, this may have altered pre-bias scores since participants completed this task immediately after being stressed. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate training-induced changes in behavior and neural response patterns relevant to work on attention bias modification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Background. - Prior studies have examined whether chronic pain patients selectively attend to pain-related stimuli in the environment, but these studies have produced largely mixed findings and focused primarily on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Limited research has implicated attentional biases among chronic headache patients, but no studies have been conducted among episodic migraineurs, who comprise the overwhelming majority of the migraine population. Methods. - This was a case-control, experimental study. Three hundred and eight participants (mean age = 19.2 years [standard deviation = 3.3]; 69.5% female; 36.4% minority), consisting of 84 episodic migraineurs, diagnosed in accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (2nd edition) criteria using a structured diagnostic interview, and 224 non-migraine controls completed a computerized dot probe task to assess attentional bias toward headache-related pictorial stimuli. The task consisted of 192 trials and utilized 2 emotional-neutral stimulus pairing conditions (headache-neutral and happy-neutral). Results. - No within-group differences for reaction time latencies to headache vs happy conditions were found among those with episodic migraine or among the non-migraine controls. Migraine status was unrelated to attentional bias indices for both headache (F [1,306] = 0.56, P =.45) and happy facial stimuli (F [1,306] = 0.37, P =.54), indicating a lack of between-group differences. Lack of within- and between-group differences was confirmed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Conclusions. - In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms. © 2012 American Headache Society.","attention; attentional bias; dot probe; episodic migraine","adult; article; case control study; controlled study; episodic migraine; experimental study; female; happiness; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; visual stimulation; Adolescent; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Case-Control Studies; Disability Evaluation; Emotions; Female; Headache; Humans; Male; Migraine Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874406386

Furthermore, a series of studies in individuals with low self-esteem has shown that they benefit from a single session of an ABM variant based on a visual search task. The current study tested the working mechanism of visual search ABM in dysphoria. Methods: Forty dysphoric individuals engaged in a single session of ABM training or control training. Attentional bias for positive and negative facial expressions was assessed pre- and post training. Positive and negative mood states were assessed throughout the procedure. Results: Attentional training had no effect on attentional bias. Positive and negative mood states were not differentially affected by training condition.

In response, some companies empower employees to respond to customer blogs, which requires employees to recognize the customer's perspective. We show that attentional bias modification can be used to prime employees of two global Fortune 100 companies with a self-sufficiency or empathy bias. The results indicate that narrative transportation, or the extent to which employees mentally enter the world evoked by a customer's story, mediates the effect of attentional bias on two relevant psychological ownership dimensions: acknowledgment of responsibility and willingness to respond. Participants with a self-sufficiency bias neither acknowledge responsibility nor want to respond. However, participants primed with an empathy bias take responsibility for the customer's case and respond to the integrity violation. We find evidence for two boundary conditions of this effect: (1) it strengthens when the employee perceives the customer's financial vulnerability as high and (2) it weakens when the customer is impolite in the blog post. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Attentional bias modification; Empathy; Psychological ownership; Social media; Transportation",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871606824

Therefore, ABMT research should take into account the impact of attention bias stability on attention training response, especially in pediatric populations. ABMT research typically relies on the dot-probe task, where individuals detect a probe following an emotional-neutral stimulus pair. The current research presents two dot-probe experiments relevant to ABMT and attention-bias stability. In Experiment 1, anxious youth receiving 8-weeks of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) were randomly assigned to ABMT that trains attention towards happy faces (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18). Two additional comparison groups, anxious youth receiving only CBT (n = 17) and healthy comparison youth (n = 16), were studied. Active attention training towards happy faces did not augment clinician-rated response to CBT; however, individuals receiving training exhibited reductions on self-report measures of anxiety earlier than individuals receiving CBT only. In Experiment 2, healthy youth (n = 12) completed a dot-probe task twice while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Intra-class correlation demonstrated stability of neural activation in response to attention bias in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala.

Results: Children randomized to ATP showed greater post-training attention bias towards happy faces than children randomized to ATC. ATP also produced significantly greater reductions in clinician-rated diagnostic severity and number of diagnoses, compared to ATC.

The excessive rates of PTSD and other adjustment disorders in soldiers returning home make it imperative to identify risk and resilience factors that could be targeted by novel therapeutic treatments. Objective: To investigate the interplay among attention to threat, combat exposure, and other risk factors for PTSD symptoms in soldiers deployed to combat. Design and Setting: Longitudinal prospective study of Israeli Defense Force infantry soldiers carried out in 2008 through 2010. Repeated measurements during a 1-year period included baseline and predeployment data collected in training camps and deployment data collected in the combat theater. Participants: Infantry soldiers (1085 men; mean age, 18.8 years). Main Outcome Measures: Postcombat PTSD symptoms. Results: Soldiers developed threat vigilance during combat deployment, particularly when they were exposed to high-intensity combat, as indicated by faster response times to targets appearing at the location of threat relative to neutral stimuli (P<.001). Threat-related attention bias also interacted with combat exposure to predict risk for PTSD (P<.05). Bias toward threat at recruitment (P<.001) and bias away from threat just before deployment (P<.05) predicted postcombat PTSD symptoms. Moreover, these threatrelated attention associations with PTSD were moderated by genetic and environmental factors, including serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype. Conclusions and Relevance: Combat exposure interacts with threat-related attention to place soldiers at risk for PTSD, and interactions with other risk factors account for considerable variance in PTSD vulnerability. Understanding these associations informs research on novel attention bias modification techniques and prevention of PTSD. © 2013 American Medical Association.

However, attentional bias to threat has not typically been found in unselected individuals using behavioral measures in the dot-probe task, one of the most common ways of examining attention to threat. The present study leveraged event-related potentials (ERPs) in conjunction with behavioral measures in the dot-probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals. As in previous dot-probe studies, we found no evidence of an attentional bias to threat using reaction time; additionally, this measure exhibited poor internal reliability. In contrast, ERPs revealed an initial shift of attention to threat-related stimuli, reflected by the N2pc, which showed moderate internal reliability. However, there was no evidence of sustained engagement with the threat-related stimuli, as measured by the late positive potential (LPP). Together, these results demonstrate that unselected individuals do initially allocate attention to threat in the dot-probe task, and further, that this bias is better characterized by neural measures of attention than traditional behavioral measures. These results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both unselected and anxious populations. © The Author (2014).","Attentional bias; Dot probe; ERPs; IAPS; Threat","adolescent; adult; attention; electroencephalography; evoked response; fear; female; human; male; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; reproducibility; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926463314

Afterwards they performed an emotional dot-probe paradigm. Stress induced negative affect and a rise in salivary cortisol. Stress caused a pattern of functional asymmetry in the short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) interval, which was absent in the control group. Stressed participants responded faster to angry faces presented to the LVHF, but responded faster to happy faces presented to the right VHF. This could suggest that stress influences interhemispheric transfer of information that is relevant for emotion processing. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Attention; Cortisol; Dot-probe paradigm; Hemispheric asymmetry; Stress; Valence","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; article; attention; brain asymmetry; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; exercise test; feedback system; human; male; mental stress; mental task; priority journal; psychologic test; randomized controlled trial; response time; right hemisphere; social stress; affect; attention; facial expression; hemispheric dominance; mental stress; metabolism; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; psychology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; saliva; visual field; Affect; Attention; Facial Expression; Functional Laterality; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Visual Fields","B4, DFG, California Department of Fish and Game; SFB; DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","Correspondence should be addressed to: Oliver T.

We investigated whether a single intranasal dose of OT (24 IU) would modulate the allocation of attentional resources towards positive and negative facial expressions using a dot-probe paradigm in a sample of 69 healthy men. Attentional capacity for these facial cues was limited by presentation time (100 or 500 ms). In addition, we controlled for overt visual attention by recording eye movements using a remote eye tracker. Reaction times (RTs) in the dot-probe paradigm revealed a pronounced shift of attention towards happy facial expressions presented for 100 ms after OT administration, whereas there were no OT-induced effects for longer presentation times (500 ms). The results could not be attributed to modulations of overt visual attention as no substance effects on gazes towards the facial target were observed. The results suggest that OT increased covert attention to happy faces, thereby supporting the hypothesis that OT modulates early attentional processes that might promote prosocial behavior.",,"oxytocin; placebo; adult; association; attention; controlled study; drug effects; eye movement; facial expression; happiness; human; intranasal drug administration; male; perception; physiology; randomized controlled trial; vision; young adult; Administration, Intranasal; Adult; Attention; Cues; Eye Movements; Facial Expression; Happiness; Humans; Male; Oxytocin; Placebos; Social Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897366578

We aimed at investigating whether a singular major pain experience also changes cognitive-emotional processing. The influence of acute postoperative pain after cosmetic surgery of the thorax was tested in 80 preoperatively pain-free male individuals. Acute pain was measured as independent variable during the first week postsurgery by pain intensity ratings and the requested analgesic boluses (Patient-Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA)). Pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)), pain anxiety (Pain Anxiety and Symptom Scale (PASS)), pain hypervigilance (Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire (PVAQ)), and attentional biases to emotionally loaded stimuli (including pain) in a dot-probe task were assessed 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postsurgery as dependent variables. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to test whether the 2 acute pain parameters can predict these cognitive-emotional variables. As a rigorous test, significant prediction was required in addition to the prediction of the dependent variables by themselves with lag-1. Acute pain (mainly the pain ratings) appeared to be a significant predictor for PCS, PASS, and PVAQ 1 week after surgery (deltaR2= [8.7% to 11.3%]). In contrast, the attentional biases in the dot-probe task could not be predicted by the pain ratings. The levels of pain catastrophizing and pain hypervigilance increased in the acute phase after surgery when influenced by acute pain and declined, along with pain anxiety, during the next 3 months. In conclusion, a one-time intense pain experience, such as acute postoperative pain, appeared to produce at least short-lived changes in the attentional and emotional processing of pain.","Acute pain; Dot-probe task; Pain catastrophizing; Pain hypervigilance; Pain-related anxiety; Postoperative pain","adolescent; adult; article; attention; catastrophizing; dependent variable; emotion; epidural anesthesia; esthetic surgery; funnel chest; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale; pain assessment; Pain Catastrophizing Scale; Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire; postoperative pain; prediction; priority journal; statistics; Acute pain; Dot-probe task; Pain catastrophizing; Pain hypervigilance; Pain-related anxiety; Postoperative pain; Acute Pain; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Emotions; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pain Measurement; Pilot Projects; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult","La 685/6, DFG, California Department of Fish and Game; DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, La 685/6).

However, the degree of stimulus processing in the irrelevant modality and the temporal cascade of the attentional modulations in either the relevant or irrelevant modalitiesare unknown. Here, we employed an audiovisual conflict paradigm with a sensory probe in the task-irrelevant modality(vision) to gauge the attentional allocation to that modality. ERPs were recorded as participants attended to and discriminated spoken auditory letters while ignoring simultaneous bilateral visual letter stimuli that were either fully congruent, fully incongruent, or partially incongruent (one side incongruent, one congruent) with the auditory stimulation. Half of the audiovisual letter stimuli were followed 500-700 msec later by a bilateral visual probe stimulus. As expected, ERPs to the audiovisual stimuli showed an incongruency ERP effect (fully incongruent versus fully congruent) of an enhanced, centrally distributed, negative-polarity wave starting ~250 msec. More critically here, the sensory ERP components to the visual probes were larger when they followed fully incongruent versus fully congruent multisensory stimuli, with these enhancements greatest on fully incongruent trials with the slowest RTs. In addition, on the slowest-response partially incongruent trials, the P2 sensory component to the visual probes was larger contralateral to the preceding incongruent visual stimulus. These data suggest that, in response to conflicting multisensory stimulus input, the initial cognitive effect is a capture of attention by the incongruent irrelevant-modality input, pulling neural processing resources toward that modality, resulting in rapid enhancement, rather than rapid suppression, of that input. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"adult; article; audiovisual aid; auditory stimulation; behavioral science; cognition; conflict; controlled study; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; male; molecular probe; multisensory conflict; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; normal human; priority journal; sensory probe; sensory stimulation; task performance; vision; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874568121

The study of intermediate phenotypes, such as emotionprocessing biases and their neural substrates, provides a way to clarify the mechanisms by which FKBP5 dysregulation mediates risk for psychiatric disorders. Objective: To examine whether allelic variations for a putatively functional single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with FKBP5 gene regulation (rs1360780) would relate differentially to attention bias for threat. this was measured through behavioral response on a dot probe task and hippocampal activation during task performance. Morphologic substrates of differential hippocampal response were also measured. Design: Cross-sectional study conducted from 2010 to 2012 examining associations between genotype, behavioral response, and neural response (using functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) on the dot probe; voxelbased morphometry and global and local shape analyses were used to measure structural differences in hippocampi between genotype groups. Setting: Participants were recruited from primary care clinics of a publicly funded hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants: An African American cohort of adults (N=103) was separated into 2 groups by genotype: one genotype group included carriers of the rs1360780 T allele, which has been associated with increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and affective disorders; the other group did not carry this allele. Behavioral data included both sexes (N=103); the MRI cohort (n=36) included only women. Main Outcome Measures: Behavioral and fMRI (blood oxygen level-dependent) response, voxel-based morphometry, and shape analyses. Results: Carriers of the rs1360780 T allele showed an attention bias toward threat compared with individuals without this allele (F <inf>1,90</inf>=5.19, P=.02). Carriers of this allele demonstrated corresponding increases in hippocampal activation and differences in morphology; global and local shape analyses revealed alterations in hippocampal shape for TT/TC compared with CC genotype groups. Conclusion: Genetic variants of FKBP5 may be associated with risk for stress-related psychiatric disorders via differential effects on hippocampal structure and function, resulting in altered attention response to perceived threat. © 2013 American Medical Association.

We investigated early, intermediate, and sustained forms of bias using behavioral measures and pupillary reactivity, an index of cognitive and affective load, to gain insight into potential neurocognitive targets for early intervention. Method Twenty nonanxious youth and 74 youth with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), and/or social phobia (SP) completed a dot-probe task, which requires participants to respond to a dot replacing either a neutral or fearful face. Emotional faces were presented for short/early (200 ms) or intermediate (2 s) intervals and followed by a sustained (up to 10.5 s) poststimulus interval. Pupil dilation, gaze direction, and reaction times (RTs) were measured during task completion. Results Early and intermediate vigilance patterns in RTs and an avoidant pattern in gaze direction were observed in all participants irrespective of anxiety. Sustained pupil dilation in anxious youth was observed on trials in which the dot replaced fearful faces, along with an inflexible pattern of pupillary responding in comparison to controls. Conclusion Sustained cognitive-affective load following emotional face viewing is altered and inflexible in anxious youth. These prolonged alterations extend well beyond the time frame of behavioral attentional bias and may indicate inflexible and insufficient sustained cognitive control.

However, there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of internet-based ATs in clinical populations. The current trial examined effects of an internet-based AT on self-report measures, behavioral data and diagnostic status in individuals with social phobia (N = 56).

Best characterized in the visual domain, it is typically depicted as a spotlight moving over a saliency map that topographically encodes strengths of visual features and feedback modulations over the visual scene. By introducing smells to two well-established attentional paradigms, the dot-probe and the visual-search paradigms, we find that a smell reflexively directs attention to the congruent visual image and facilitates visual search of that image without the mediation of visual imagery. Furthermore, such effect is independent of, and can override, top-down bias. We thus propose that smell quality acts as an object feature whose presence enhances the perceptual saliency of that object, thereby guiding the spotlight of visual attention. Our discoveries provide robust empirical evidence for a multimodal saliency map that weighs not only visual but also olfactory inputs. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Participants underwent a minimal group manipulation and then performed a dot probe task assessing attentional biases. People who perceived the outgroup as dangerous had their attention captured selectively by images of outgroup males. Danger perceptions were unassociated with attention to outgroup females and ingroup targets.

Objective: We investigated self-report and physiological correlates of attention biases in 27 IPV-exposed women. Method: Participants completed self-report measures of trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and dissociation; were monitored physiologically during baseline; and responded to an emotional dot probe task. Results: Participants showed bias away from positive and anxiety words, and toward IPV words. Lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and higher skin conductance levels were associated with bias away from anxiety cues. Greater total PTSD symptoms were associated with bias toward IPV cues, and greater PTSD intrusion and avoidance symptoms were associated with lower RSA. Individuals exposed to more types of trauma had lower heart rates. Conclusions: These data extend the research on emotion-cognition interactions in PTSD and other anxiety disorders to chronic IPV survivors, in part confirming avoidance and intrusion symptom and attention bias relations found in studies.

Thus, the model predicts that arousal simultaneously enhances processing of salient stimuli and impairs processing of relatively less-salient stimuli. We tested this model with a simple dot-probe task. On each trial, participants were simultaneously exposed to one face image as a salient cue stimulus and one place image as a non-salient stimulus. A border around the face cue location further increased its bottom-up saliency. Before these visual stimuli were shown, one of two tones played: one that predicted a shock (increasing arousal) or one that did not. An arousal-by-saliency interaction in category-specific brain regions (fusiform face area for salient faces and parahippocampal place area for non-salient places) indicated that brain activation associated with processing the salient stimulus was enhanced under arousal whereas activation associated with processing the non-salient stimulus was suppressed under arousal. This is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging study to demonstrate that arousal can enhance information processing for prioritized stimuli while simultaneously impairing processing of non-prioritized stimuli. Thus, it goes beyond previous research to show that arousal does not uniformly enhance perceptual processing, but instead does so selectively in ways that optimizes attention to highly salient stimuli. © The Author (2014).

Results indicated a two-stage processing of attention modulation by threats. When participants viewed the cues that were represented by Chinese faces (i.e. the in-group condition), it was found at the early processing stage that an angry face elicited a larger occipital P1 component whereas a disgusted face elicited a smaller P1 for validly than for invalidly cued targets. However, the result pattern was reversed at the later processing stage: the P3 amplitudes were larger for valid disgust cues but were smaller for valid angry cues, when both were compared with invalid cue conditions. In addition, when participants viewed the cues that were represented by foreign faces (i.e. the out-group condition), the attention modulation of disgust/anger diminished at the early stage, whereas enhanced P3 amplitudes were observed in response to validly cued targets in both disgusting and angry conditions at the later stage. The current result implied that although people can perceptually differentiate the emotional categories of out-group faces as accurately as in-group faces, they may still be not able to psychologically understand the subtle differences behind different categories of out-group facial expressions. © The Author (2014).","Anger; Attention; Disgust; Threat-related emotion","adult; anger; association; attention; cultural anthropology; electroencephalography; emotion; evoked response; face; facial expression; fear; female; human; male; occipital lobe; perception; photostimulation; physiology; psychology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; young adult; Adult; Anger; Attention; Cues; Culture; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evoked Potentials; Face; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Occipital Lobe; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Social Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926456314

Evidence for this assumption was provided by dot probe and feedback tasks measuring attention and reactions to internal cues. However, it is unclear whether similar patterns of attentional processing can be revealed while participants actually engage in a social situation. The current study used a novel paradigm, simultaneously measuring attention to internal and external stimuli in anticipation of and during a speech task. Methods: Participants with speech anxiety and non-anxious controls were asked to press a button in response to external or internal probes, while giving a speech on a controversial topic in front of an audience. The external probe consisted of a LED attached to the head of one spectator and the internal probe was a light vibration, which ostensibly signaled changes in participants' pulse or skin conductance. Results: The results indicate that during speech anticipation, high speech anxious participants responded significantly faster to internal probes than low speech anxious participants, while during the speech no differences were revealed between internal and external probes. Limitations: Generalization of our results is restricted to speech anxious individuals.

In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural activity in long-presentation trials. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Attentional bias; cue reactivity; fMRI; inhibition; pathological computer game playing","addiction; adolescent; adult; anterior cingulate; article; association; attention disturbance; attentional bias; behavior disorder; brain function; brain region; clinical article; controlled study; corpus striatum; cue reactivity; frontal gyrus; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; inferior frontal gyrus; lingual gyrus; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nerve cell network; neurobiology; orbitofrontal gyrus; pathological computer game playing; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; recreation; substance abuse; task performance; visual stimulation; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Cues; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Inhibition (Psychology); Internet; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Time Factors; Video Games; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871817742

Participants were 59 children (31 boys) aged 10-16 years and one of their parents (41 mothers). Children performed a dot-probe task in which child facial pain displays of varying pain expressiveness were presented. Child avoidance behaviour was indexed by child pain tolerance during a cold-pressor task. Children and parents completed measures of child and parent pain catastrophizing, respectively. Findings indicated that both the nature of child selective attention to pain and the impact of selective attention upon child avoidance behaviour were differentially sensitive to specific dimensions of child and parental catastrophizing. Specifically, findings showed greater tendency to shift attention away from pain faces (ie, attentional avoidance) among children reporting greater pain magnification. A similar pattern was observed in terms of parental characteristics, such that children increasingly shifted attention away from pain with increasing levels of parental rumination and helplessness. Furthermore, child attentional avoidance was associated with greater avoidance behaviour (ie, lower pain tolerance) among children reporting high levels of pain magnification and those whose parents reported greater rumination about pain. The current findings corroborate catastrophizing as a multidimensional construct that may differentially impact outcomes and attest to the importance of assessing both child and parental characteristics in relation to child pain-related attention and avoidance behaviour.

Our objective was to conduct an effect size analysis of ABM across a wide range of samples and psychological problems. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, PsycInfo, and author searches to identify randomized studies that examined the effects of ABM on attention and subjective experiences. We identified 37 studies (41 experiments) totaling 2,135 participants who were randomized to training toward neutral, positive, threat, or appetitive stimuli or to a control condition. The effect size estimate for changes in attentional bias was large for the neutral versus threat comparisons (g=1.06), neutral versus appetitive (g=1.41), and neutral versus control comparisons (g=0.80), and small for positive versus control (g=0.24). The effects of ABM on attention bias were moderated by stimulus type (words vs. pictures) and sample characteristics (healthy vs. high symptomatology). Effect sizes of ABM on subjective experiences ranged from 0.03 to 0.60 for postchallenge outcomes, -0.31 to 0.51 for posttreatment, and were moderated by number of training sessions, stimulus type, and stimulus orientation (top/bottom vs. left/right). Fail-safe N calculations suggested that the effect size estimates were robust for the training effects on attentional biases, but not for the effect on subjective experiences. ABM studies using threat stimuli produced significant effects on attention bias across comparison conditions, whereas appetitive stimuli produced changes in attention only when comparing appetitive versus neutral conditions. ABM has a moderate and robust effect on attention bias when using threat stimuli. Further studies are needed to determine whether these effects are also robust when using appetitive stimuli and for affecting subjective experiences. © 2012.","Anxiety; Attention; Cognitive bias modification; Meta-analysis; Review","appetite; article; attention; attention bias modification; behavior theory; controlled study; human; mental disease; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patient safety; personal experience; randomized controlled trial; sensory stimulation; symptomatology; therapy effect; threat; visual stimulation; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Humans",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867223023

Although much is already known about the therapeutic effects of attentional bias training, only a few studies have examined the mechanism responsible for these effects. In order to test if low-level, cognitive effects of attentional bias training depend on attentional control, 73 participants, who completed the STAI-x2 and the ACS questionnaires, were randomly assigned to a control (n = 37) or attentional training group (n = 36). The attentional manipulation was followed by a search task, during which novel neutral or negative faces could be presented within an array of all-neutral, all-negative or all-positive faces. It was found that individuals with higher ACS score displayed stronger attentional training effects, i.e., they were less accurate in detecting distinctive negative faces, and this effect was not found to be associated with STAI-x2 score. These results show that there is individual variability even in immediate, cognitive effects of attentional bias modification and that special abilities, such as attentional control, might be required for attentional training to be efficient. © 2012, Versita.

In Experiment 1, we used a multiple-objecttracking task (MOT; three targets, three distractors) combined with a probe detection task to investigate the distribution of attention around a target object. We found anisotropic probe detection rates with increased probe detection at locations where a target is heading. In Experiment 2, we introduced a black line (wall) in the center of the screen and block-wise manipulated the object's motion: either objects bounced realistically against the wall or objects went through the wall. Just before a target coincided with the wall, a probe could appear either along the bounce path or along the straight path. In addition to MOT, we included a single-object-tracking task (SOT; one target, five distractors) to control for attentional load. We found that linear extrapolation is dominant (better probe detection along the straight path than bounce path) regardless of attentional load and the motion condition. Anticipation of bouncing behavior did occur but only when attentional load was low. We conclude that attention is not tightly bound to moving target objects but encompasses the object's current position and the area in front of it.

Binge-eating represents a useful model of 'behavioural addiction' for exploring this issue. Objective: The aim of this study was to objectively assess the cognitive effects of a mu opioid receptor antagonist in obese individuals with binge-eating symptoms. Methods: Adults with moderate to severe binge-eating and body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 received 4 weeks of treatment with a mu opioid receptor antagonist (GSK1521498) 2 or 5 mg per day, or placebo, in a double-blind randomised parallel design. Neuropsychological assessment was undertaken at baseline and endpoint to quantify processing bias for food stimuli (visual dot probe with 500- and 2,000-ms stimulus presentations and food Stroop tasks) and other distinct cognitive functions (N-back working memory, sustained attention, and power of attention tasks). Results: GSK1521498 5 mg/day significantly reduced attentional bias for food cues on the visual dot probe task versus placebo (p = 0.042), with no effects detected on other cognitive tasks (all p &gt; 0.10). The effect on attentional bias was limited to the longer stimulus duration condition in the higher dose cohort alone. Conclusions: These findings support a central role for mu opioid receptors in aspects of attentional processing of food cues but militate against the notion of major modulatory influences of mu opioid receptors in working memory and sustained attention. The findings have implications for novel therapeutic directions and suggest that the role of different opioid receptors in cognition merits further research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Binge-eating; Cognition; Impulsivity; Mu; Mu-opioid; Opiate; Opioid","gsk 1521498; mu opiate receptor; mu opiate receptor antagonist; placebo; unclassified drug; adult; article; attention; binge eating disorder; cognition; controlled study; dose response; double blind procedure; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental task; multicenter study; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stimulus response; treatment outcome; working memory; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Binge-Eating Disorder; Cognition; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Indans; Male; Middle Aged; Narcotic Antagonists; Neuropsychological Tests; Receptors, Opioid, mu; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Triazoles; Young Adult","P1Vital; University of Southampton; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; SRC, Semiconductor Research Corporation; GSK, GlaxoSmithKline foundation","Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank all participants and support staff at GSK.

Results concerning the efficacy of distraction from both experimental and clinical studies are variable, however, and indicate that its efficacy may depend on particular circumstances. Several models propose that distraction may be less effective for people who display a large attentional bias towards pain-related information. This hypothesis was tested in an experimental context with 53 pain-free volunteers. First, attentional bias towards cues signalling the occurrence of pain (electrocutaneous stimuli) and towards words describing the sensory experience of this painful stimulus was independently assessed by means of 2 behavioural paradigms (respectively, spatial cueing task and dot-probe task). This was followed by a subsequent distraction task during which the efficacy of distraction, by directing attention away from the electrocutaneous stimuli, was tested. In addition, state-trait anxiety, catastrophic thinking, and initial pain intensity were measured. Results indicated that people who display a large attentional bias towards predictive cues of pain or who initially experience the pain as more painful benefit less from distraction on a subsequent test. No effects were found between attentional bias towards pain words, state-trait anxiety, catastrophic thinking, and the efficacy of distraction. Current findings suggest that distraction should not be used as a 'one size fits all' method to control pain, but only under more specific conditions. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Therefore, this study tested the hypotheses that the modification of attentional bias at an early stage would reduce depressive mood and cortisol response. Fifty-three participants were allocated alternately either to the training or the control group. They were administered attention retraining for modification of attentional bias or a sham attention task, and then underwent a stress task. With respect to depressive mood response, depressive mood increased in response to a stress task in the control group, while for high-dysphoric participants in the training group, depressive mood response remained constant.

These findings are often explained in terms of a hard-wired and relatively inflexible fear module. We propose an alternative, more flexible mechanism, arguing that motivational relevance is the crucial factor driving rapid attentional orienting. To test our hypothesis, we endowed initially neutral face stimuli with relevance by randomly assigning them to a social in-group or out-group during a 1-min learning phase, and used these faces as cues in a dot probe task to measure rapid attentional orienting. Across three experiments, we observed attentional orienting toward faces assigned to the out-group. Initial rapid orienting (after 100. ms, Experiments 1 and 2) was observed only for familiar faces for which group membership was explicitly encoded, suggesting that rapid orienting may be based on affectively charged memory traces. At a later time point (after 500. ms, Experiment 3), attention was deployed toward unfamiliar faces sharing a physical attribute (background color) with the familiar out-group faces, suggesting a more time-consuming on-line appraisal of the stimulus. The amount of attentional bias to out-group faces was correlated with individual differences in the accessibility of group identification. Our findings demonstrate that attentional prioritization mechanisms can be flexibly tuned by a brief learning phase of social identity. This is consistent with the idea that attention mechanisms subserving the selection and prioritization of emotional aspects of the environment are not static and hard-wired, but may rapidly adapt to recent changes in motivational contingencies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Attention; Dot probe; Emotion; Flexibility; Social identity","article; attention; emotion; human; priority journal; response time; social learning; stimulation; task performance; Attention; Cues; Emotions; Face; Female; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Social Identification; Young Adult","PA00P1_131435, SNF, Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; NYU, New York University","The authors would like to thank Leslie Berntsen and Aden Ratner-Stauber for assistance with data collection and members of the New York University Social Perception and Evaluation Lab for their thoughtful comments on this manuscript.

Participants (N=57) performed the approach avoidance task, picture rating task and visual dot probe task, which was combined with eye-tracking methodology. They were admitted to a forensic setting and were all abstinent and undergoing treatment at the time of testing. Three groups were formed based on the severity of alcohol use-related problems as measured by the AUDIT. In line with the expectations, no differences were found between participants based on the severity of their alcohol use-related problems. In addition, three groups were formed based on IQ to assess the relationship between IQ and the strength of the cognitive biases. There were also no differences between individuals with mild or borderline ID and individuals with (below) average IQ on any of the variables. It is concluded that computer tasks such as these can be used in individuals with mild to borderline ID. As the results suggest no influence of IQ on the strength of cognitive biases, this study opens up new opportunities for future research on the application of measuring cognitive biases in screening, diagnosing and treating individuals with mild to borderline ID and alcohol use-related problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Addiction; Alcohol; Cognitive biases; Eye tracking; Mild intellectual disability","adult; alcohol abstinence; alcohol use disorder; analysis of variance; article; avoidance behavior; cognition; cognitive biases; computer interface; controlled study; disease severity; eye tracking; female; human; intellectual impairment; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; medical research; mental performance; pilot study; task performance; visual stimulation; Adult; Alcoholism; Attention; Cognition Disorders; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Comorbidity; Ethanol; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Netherlands; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Perceptual Distortion; Pilot Projects; Reaction Time; Saccades; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; Temperance",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862700295

A healthy volunteer model of emotional processing was used to assess the neuropsychological profile of action of memantine. Healthy volunteers (n=32) were randomised to receive a single dose of memantine (10 mg) or placebo, and subsequently completed a battery of tasks measuring emotional processing, including facial expression recognition, emotional memory, dot-probe and emotion-potentiated startle tasks, as well as working and verbal memory. Memantine treated volunteers showed an increased emotion-potentiated startle, and a reduced bias for negative items in emotional recognition memory. There were no effects of the drug on any other aspect of emotional or non-emotional information processing. These results suggest that a single dose of memantine produces an early anxiogenic response in the emotion-potentiated startle similar to that seen following a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram.

However, no previous study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine study reports the effects of a computerized attentional bias modification (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening response) in patients with recurrent depression. Methods: Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were measured immediately before and after completion of the bias modification and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up. Results: Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred during the month following completion of bias modification. Word-based modification did not influence the outcome measures. Conclusions: Positive face-based ABM was able to reduce intermediate measures of recurrence risk in previously depressed patients. These results suggest that ABM may provide a ""cognitive vaccine"" against depression and offer a useful strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Attention; cognitive bias; depression; experimental medicine; prevention","hydrocortisone; placebo; adult; article; attentional bias modification; Beck Depression Inventory; cognitive therapy; controlled study; depression; female; Hamilton scale; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; remission; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; task performance; treatment outcome; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Cognitive Therapy; Depression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Recurrence; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866014524

During the attentional bias induction, participants completed modified versions of a dot-probe task; for half of the participants the task was designed to induce a biased attentional response for faces expressing disgust, for the other half, the task induced no bias. Then, all participants were exposed to a task inducing social rejection. Results indicate that the induction of an attentional bias for threatening information resulted in increased anxiety during social rejection.

The goal of this study was to explore a potential mechanism to explain this relationship. It was hypothesized that college-age nonsmokers who have smoking parents would express an attentional bias for smoking-related cues relative to those without smoking parents. Participants were grouped according to whether one or both of their parents smoked (n = 32) or neither parent smoked (n = 31). A dot-probe paradigm was used in which picture pairs that consisted of a smoking-related picture and a nonsmoking control picture were displayed for either 500 or 2,000 ms. Each picture pair contained either human elements or objects alone. Attentional bias was calculated by subtracting reaction times to the smoking stimuli from nonsmoking stimuli as a function of content and presentation time. Participants with at least one smoking parent demonstrated an attentional bias to smoking-related pictures relative to control pictures when displayed for 2,000 ms, but only when they did not contain human content. Participants without a smoking parent showed no attentional bias. These results suggest that college-age nonsmokers who have smoking parents may be at-risk for late-onset smoking initiation because of their enhanced attention to smoking-related cues. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","attention; dot-probe; nonsmokers; parental smoking","adolescent smoking; adult; alcohol consumption; article; child behavior; child parent relation; college student; controlled study; female; high risk population; human; human experiment; male; parental smoking; passive smoking; population exposure; questionnaire; response time; risk assessment; stimulus response; student attitude; adolescent; association; attention; drinking behavior; motivation; passive smoking; pattern recognition; psychological aspect; reaction time; smoking; student; Adolescent; Alcohol Drinking; Association; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Parenting; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Smoking; Students; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875068758

We used a dot probe procedure to investigate the relationship between dysmorphic concern, a defining feature of BDD, and selective attention to faces, attractive, unattractive and disgusting images in a female heterosexual student population (N= 92). At the long stimulus presentation (1000. ms), dysmorphic concern was positively associated with attention to faces in general and attractive appearance-related images.

Information-processing biases related to memory and attention likely play a role in the development and persistence of BD among adolescents; however, these biases have not been extensively studied in youth with BD. Methods: We administered the self-referent encoding task and the dot-probe task to adolescents with bipolar I disorder (BD, n = 35) and a demographically similar healthy comparison group (HC, n = 25) at baseline, and at a 1-year follow-up in a subset of this cohort (n = 22 per group). Results: At both baseline and 1-year follow-up, there were significant interactions of group (BD, HC) and valence of stimulus (positive, negative adjective) on endorsement and recall of self-referent adjectives. HC adolescents endorsed and recalled more positive self-referent adjectives at baseline and follow-up while adolescents with BD endorsed and recalled more negative self-referent adjectives at baseline but not follow-up. Over time, depression symptomatology was associated with impaired memory for positive self-referent adjectives. There were no group differences in attentional bias at either time points. Conclusions: Adolescents with BD exhibit bias away from endorsement and recall of positive adjectives, which remained stable over time and independent of mood state. © 2012 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Adolescence; bipolar disorder; information-processing; longitudinal; memory bias","adolescent; article; attention; bipolar disorder; follow up; human; memory; mental function; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological aspect; psychological rating scale; Wechsler Intelligence Scale; Adolescent; Attention; Bipolar Disorder; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Memory; Mental Processes; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Wechsler Scales",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865492733

The study employed pictures of neutral, happy and angry facial expressions as they have greater ecological value compared to words. Children completed a dot-probe task measuring attentional biases toward such stimuli. They also completed the Spence Child Anxiety Scale for anxiety symptoms and, for attentional control, the child version of the Attention Control Scale measuring the ability to focus and shift attention. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis showed that attentional control significantly explained anxiety.

The primary goal of the current study was to examine whether college students who drink to escape dysphoric emotions or moods (i.e., escape drinkers) have stronger attentional biases for alcohol-related cues than non-escape drinkers. Additionally, because previous research has shown that presentation time and content of smoking-related stimuli moderates differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' reaction times, this study sought to determine whether these effects generalized to alcohol-related stimuli. Participants who were identified as either escape (n = 74) or non-escape drinkers (n = 48) completed a dot-probe task in which alcohol-related pictures that contained humans interacting with the alcohol-related cues (active) or alcohol-related cues alone (inactive) were presented along with matched control pictures. These stimuli were presented for either 500 ms or 2000 ms to determine whether attentional biases occur as a function of initial or maintained attention to the alcohol-related cues. Escape drinkers displayed a significantly stronger attentional bias for alcohol-related inactive cues at longer presentation times (i.e., 2000 ms) compared to non-escape drinkers. This bias was independent of alcohol dependence and family history of alcoholism. These results suggest that in addition to dependence and family history, escape drinking is an important factor to consider when examining attentional biases to alcohol-related cues. © 2012.","Alcohol consumption; Attentional bias; College students; Escape drinking","adult; alcohol consumption; article; association; attentional bias; controlled study; drinking behavior; dysphoria; emotion; escape behavior; female; human; human experiment; male; mood; normal human; questionnaire; smoking; stimulus; systematic error; task performance; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Attention; Binge Drinking; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Smoking; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864527668

One way that drugs may affect social behavior is by altering social processing, for example by decreasing perceptions of negative emotion in others. Objectives We examined effects of d-amphetamine on processing of emotional facial expressions and on the social behavior of talking. We predicted amphetamine would enhance attention, identification, and responsivity to positive expressions, and that this in turn would predict increased talkativeness. Methods Over three sessions, 36 healthy normal adults received placebo, 10, and 20 mg d-amphetamine under counterbalanced double-blind conditions. At each session, we measured processing of happy, fearful, sad, and angry expressions using an attentional visual probe task, a dynamic emotion identification task, and measures of facial muscle activity. We also measured talking. Results Amphetamine decreased the threshold for identifying all emotions, increased negative facial responses to sad expressions, and increased talkativeness. Contrary to our hypotheses, amphetamine did not alter attention to, identification of, or facial responses to positive emotions specifically. Interestingly, the drug decreased the threshold to identify all emotions, and this effect was uniquely related to increased talkativeness, even after controlling for overall sensitivity to amphetamine. Conclusions The results suggest that amphetamine may encourage sociability by increasing sensitivity to subtle emotional expressions. These findings suggest novel social mechanisms that may contribute to the rewarding effects of amphetamine. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Amphetamine; Attentional bias; Emotional faces; Psychophysiology; Social interaction","dexamphetamine; placebo; recreational drug; adult; angry; article; controlled study; double blind procedure; emotion; facial expression; fear; female; happy; human; human experiment; male; muscle contraction; normal human; priority journal; reward; sad; social behavior; task performance; verbal behavior; Adolescent; Adult; Amphetamine; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Facial Expression; Facial Muscles; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Sensory Thresholds; Social Behavior; Verbal Behavior; Young Adult","WIT, Wentworth Institute of Technology; R01 DA02812, NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse; T32 DA007255, NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse","Acknowledgments The authors thank Dr. John Cacioppo and his staff at the University of Chicago Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience for their technical assistance; Adam D.

Twenty-one outpatient youth (aged 15-24 years) meeting three or more DSM-IV BPD criteria and 20 community-derived participants (aged 15-24 years) with no history of psychiatric problems and not meeting any BPD criteria completed a modified dot-probe task that tested automatic (30. ms) and controlled (500. ms) stages of information processing. The findings indicate that, compared with healthy controls, youth with borderline features were faster to respond to congruent rather than incongruent fear stimuli. This effect was independent of state anxiety and was observed during the 30. ms presentation of fearful faces. There was no significant effect for happy or angry faces. Youth with borderline features were also slower to respond to incongruent rather than paired neutral trials, indicating difficulties in disengaging attention from the perceived threat. Such differences were not found for the healthy controls. Thus, youth with borderline features had an attentional bias for fearful faces that reflected difficulty in disengaging attention from threatening information during pre-conscious stages of attention. This finding extends previous research highlighting the diminished capacity for affect regulation and subsequent engagement in behavioural strategies to avoid distress in BPD.

In addition, participants showed greater amplitudes of NSW to initial neutral picture primes and smaller N1 and greater P2 amplitudes to face pairs in neutral compared with negative prime condition.

EM of 21 young adults scoring high on a fear of pain measure (H-FOP) and 20 lower-scoring (L-FOP) control participants were measured during a dot-probe task that featured sensory pain-neutral, health catastrophe-neutral and neutral-neutral word pairs. Analyses indicated that the H-FOP group was more likely to direct immediate visual attention toward sensory pain and health catastrophe words than was the L-FOP group. The H-FOP group also had comparatively shorter first fixation latencies toward sensory pain and health catastrophe words. Conversely, groups did not differ on EM indices of attentional maintenance (i.e., first fixation duration, gaze duration, and average fixation duration) or reaction times to dot probes. Finally, both groups showed a cycle of disengagement followed by re-engagement toward sensory pain words relative to other word types. In sum, this research is the first to reveal biases toward pain stimuli during very early stages of visual information processing among the highly pain-fearful and highlights the utility of EM tracking as a means to evaluate visual attention as a dynamic process in the context of FOP. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Such effects have been hypothesized to play a key role in the development of later therapeutic responses to treatment. However, it is unknown whether these effects are a common mechanism of action for different treatment modalities. High-density negative ion (HDNI) treatment is an environmental manipulation that has efficacy in randomized clinical trials in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Method The current study investigated whether a single session of HDNI treatment could reverse negative affective biases seen in seasonal depression using a battery of emotional processing tasks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study. Results Under placebo conditions, participants with seasonal mood disturbance showed reduced recognition of happy facial expressions, increased recognition memory for negative personality characteristics and increased vigilance to masked presentation of negative words in a dot-probe task compared to matched healthy controls. Negative ion treatment increased the recognition of positive compared to negative facial expression and improved vigilance to unmasked stimuli across participants with seasonal depression and healthy controls. Negative ion treatment also improved recognition memory for positive information in the SAD group alone. These effects were seen in the absence of changes in subjective state or mood. Conclusions These results are consistent with the hypothesis that early change in emotional processing may be an important mechanism for treatment action in depression and suggest that these effects are also apparent with negative ion treatment in seasonal depression. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","Emotional processing; high-density negative ion treatment; seasonal affective disorder","anion; placebo; adult; affect; air; analysis of variance; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; emotion; facial expression; female; human; male; neuropsychological test; physiology; psychological aspect; psychological rating scale; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; recognition; seasonal affective disorder; statistics; treatment outcome; Adult; Affect; Air Ionization; Analysis of Variance; Anions; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Placebos; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Seasonal Affective Disorder; Treatment Outcome","G0701421, MRC, Medical Research Council; G9900922, MRC, Medical Research Council",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863974511

The present study investigated this effect in students using measures of cardiovascular responses to stress and examined whether individual differences influence the impact of attention training on stress responses. Using a standard dot probe task, 30 participants underwent negative attentional bias training and 34 participants underwent anti-negative training before completing a stressful speech task. Results indicated that, overall, participants exhibited acclimatization to the procedures (indicated by a dip in blood pressure post-training) and normal stress responding (indicated by elevated blood pressure in response to stress; p<.001). However, consideration of participants' scores for neuroticism/emotional-stability revealed important differences in how the intervention impacted on cardiovascular profiles (p=.008). For participants with high neuroticism scores, the negative attentional bias intervention elicited more exaggerated stress responding than the anti-negative intervention. For those with low neuroticism scores (i.e., emotionally stable participants), the anti-negative intervention was associated with elevated post-intervention blood pressure and higher blood pressure reactivity to stress. These findings provide evidence of the impact of attentional bias manipulation on physiological stress reactivity and suggest the effect is highly contingent on individual temperaments.",,"adult; anxiety; article; attention; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; cognitive therapy; female; heart rate; human; individuality; mental stress; methodology; pathophysiology; psychologic test; Adult; Anxiety; Attention; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Individuality; Psychological Tests; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","HEA, Higher Education Authority","This work was supported by funding from the Higher Education Authority of Ireland, Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, Cycle 4 (Irish Social Sciences Platform).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867619656

Some authors hypothesize that the activation of the mesocorticolimbic reward system triggers an attention allocation to alcohol-associated cues. Yet, no functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examining this proposition are available. In this fMRI study we investigate the association between attentional bias and neural cue reactivity. Thirty-eight recently abstinent alcohol-dependent patients were examined. fMRI was used to study cue reactivity during the presentation of alcohol-related pictures. A modified visual dot-probe task was used to assess attentional bias. Alcohol-dependent patients showed an attentional bias to alcohol-associated cues as well as cue-induced fMRI activation in response to alcohol-related stimuli in limbic and reward-related brain regions and visual areas. We found a positive correlation between cue-induced brain activation and attentional bias score in a network including frontal, temporal and subcortical regions. This study is the first demonstrating that, in line with previous suggestions, cue induced activation of the mesocorticolimbic reward system triggers focusing attention to substance-associated cues. However, this association could also be bidirectional with the attentional bias enhancing cue-induced neural activity. © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Addiction; alcoholism; attentional bias; cue reactivity; fMRI; incentive salience","alcohol; adult; aged; alcoholism; article; association; attention disturbance; clinical article; controlled study; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; limbic system; priority journal; temporal lobe; validation process; Adult; Aged; Alcoholism; Attention; Brain; Brain Diseases; Cues; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Motivation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863435259

Participants completed a visual probe task with eye movement monitoring (to measure attentional bias) and a bogus taste test (to measure alcohol-seeking) in both alcohol and placebo sessions. Heavy drinkers showed an attentional bias for alcohol cues that was unaffected by alcohol, whereas in moderate drinkers attentional bias was present after alcohol administration, but was absent after placebo. All participants voluntarily consumed more beer during the taste test after administration of alcohol compared with placebo. The effects of alcohol on attentional bias were unrelated to the effects of alcohol on beer consumption. Results are consistent with the development of tolerance, rather than sensitization, to the acute effects of alcohol on attentional biases in heavy drinkers.

In line with this idea, recent studies have illustrated that experimentally induced changes in attentional bias have an impact on both non-clinical and clinical levels of anxiety. Still, little is known about the potential transfer of computerized training of attention to different components of attentional processing of threat. Methods: In the present study, we trained participants to either avoid or attend towards threatening pictures in a dot probe task, and we examined whether this attentional training transferred to a measure of emotional interference. Results: Despite our successful manipulation of attentional bias in the dot probe task, we found no generalization of the attentional training to the interference task. Limitations: It is possible that our study lacked statistical power to reveal possible group differences in the interference task. Conclusions: Our study shows that attentional training using the dot probe task may influence the amount of attention that is given to the spatial location of threat, but not necessarily the amount of attention that is given to the semantic content of stimuli. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Threat biases can be measured experimentally through dot-probe paradigms, in which individuals detect a probe following a stimulus pair including a threat. On these tasks, individuals with anxiety tend to detect probes that occur in a location previously occupied by a threat (i.e., congruent) faster than when opposite threats (i.e., incongruent). In pediatric anxiety disorders, dot-probe paradigms detect abnormal attention biases toward threat and abnormal ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) function. However, it remains unclear if this aberrant vlPFC activation occurs while subjects process threats (e.g., angry faces) or, alternatively, while they process and respond to probes. This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study was designed to answer this question. Methods: Adolescents with either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 17) or no psychiatric diagnosis (n = 25) performed a dot-probe task involving angry and neutral faces while MEG data were collected. Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry (SAM) beamformer technique was used to determine whether there were group differences in power ratios while subjects processed threats (i.e., angry vs. neutral faces) or when subjects responded to incongruent versus. congruent probes. Results: Group differences in vlPFC activation during the response period emerged with a 1-30 Hz frequency band. No group differences in vlPFC activation were detected in response to angry-face cues. Conclusions: In the dot-probe task, anxiety-related perturbations in vlPFC activation reflect abnormal attention control when responding to behaviorally relevant probes, but not to angry faces. Given that motor responses to these probes are used to calculate threat bias, this study provides insight into the pathophysiology reflected in this commonly used marker of anxiety. In addition, this finding may inform the development of novel anxiety-disorder treatments targeting the vlPFC to enhance attention control to task-relevant demands. © 2011 The Authors.

This attentional bias depended on gaze-perception mechanisms as observed in the lack of attentional bias to a direct gaze from unnatural-looking eyes (i.e., white pupil/iris and black sclera).

The study of attentional bias and response inhibition, characteristic for addictive disorders, is relevant to the ongoing discussion on whether problematic gaming should be classified as an addictive disorder. Methods: We tested the relation between self-reported levels of problem gaming and two behavioral domains: attentional bias and response inhibition. Ninety-two male adolescents performed two attentional bias tasks (addiction-Stroop, dot-probe) and a behavioral inhibition task (go/no-go). Self-reported problem gaming was measured by the game addiction scale, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition criteria for pathological gambling and time spent on computer and/or video games. Results: Male adolescents with higher levels of self-reported problem gaming displayed signs of error-related attentional bias to game cues. Higher levels of problem gaming were also related to more errors on response inhibition, but only when game cues were presented. Conclusions: These findings are in line with the findings of attentional bias reported in clinically recognized addictive disorders, such as substance dependence and pathological gambling, and contribute to the discussion on the proposed concept of ""Addiction and Related Disorders"" (which may include non-substance-related addictive behaviors) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.","Attentional bias; Excessive computer game playing; Game addiction; Impulsivity; Pathological gaming; Reaction time; Response inhibition","addiction; adolescent; article; attention; child; child behavior; DSM-IV; human; major clinical study; male; pathological gambling; pathological gaming; priority journal; rating scale; recreation; school child; Stroop test; task performance; Adolescent; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Child; Cues; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Gambling; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Leisure Activities; Male; Netherlands; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Stroop Test; Video Games",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861579213

We explored this by using a conjunction-search task on the right side of a computer screen to bias attention while healthy subjects performed line bisection. The first experiment used a probe detection task to confirm that the conjunction-search task created a rightward attentional gradient, as manifest in response times, detection rates, and fixation patterns. In the second experiment subjects performed line bisection with or without a simultaneous conjunction-search task. Fixation patterns in the latter condition were biased rightwards as in visual neglect, and bisection also showed a rightward bias, though modest. A third experiment using the probe detection task again showed that the attentional gradient induced by the conjunction-search task was reduced when subjects also performed line bisection, perhaps explaining the modest effects on bisection bias. Finally, an experiment with briefly viewed pre-bisected lines produced similar results, showing that the small size of the bisection bias was not due to an unlimited view allowing deployment of attentional resources to counteract the conjunction-search task's attentional gradient. These results show that an attentional gradient induced in healthy subjects can produce visual neglect-like visual scanning and a rightward shift of perceived line midpoint, but the modest size of this shift points to limitations of this physiological model in simulating the pathologic effects of visual neglect. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention; Conjunction search; Ocular fixation","adult; analytical error; article; attention; biological model; controlled study; eye fixation; female; human; human experiment; line bisection; male; mental performance; neurologic disease; normal human; physiological model; response time; simulation; task performance; visual deprivation; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Perceptual Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Visual Fields; Visual Perception","NSERC, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CIHR, Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Research Chairs; MSFHR, Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research","PG was supported by an NSERC undergraduate student research award.

The dependent measures included subjective reports of craving, negative affect, and attentional biases, as measured by a modified dot-probe task, and persistence during a task to measure distress tolerance.

However, studies examining threat processing in children have obtained mixed findings. In the present study, the time-course of attentional bias for threat and behavioral interference was analyzed in a community sample of 8-18-year-old children (N=33) using a pictorial dot probe task. Threatening and neutral stimuli were shown during 17 ms (masked), 500 ms, and 1250 ms. Results provide preliminary evidence of an automatic attentional bias for threat at 17 ms that persists during later, more controlled stages of information processing (500 and 1250 ms). Furthermore, participants showed a delayed response to threat-containing trials relative to neutral trials in the 500 and 1250 ms condition, which may indicate interference by threat. Together, these results suggest that an attentional bias for threat precedes behavioral interference in children. Furthermore, results indicate that performance in daily life can be temporarily interrupted by the processing of threatening information. In addition, results of earlier studies into selective attention in children using tasks based on behavioral responses may have been confounded by interference effects of threat. For future studies, we recommend to take behavioral interference into account. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","attentional bias; children; dot probe; interference; selective attention; threat","adolescent; anxiety; article; attention; child; dissociative disorder; fear; female; human; male; photostimulation; psychological aspect; reaction time; time; Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention; Child; Dissociative Disorders; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Time Factors",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859591578

A fear-conditioned angry face (CS+), an unconditioned angry face (CS-), or an unconditioned face with a neutral or happy expression were used in distractor interference and attentional probe tasks. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants classified centrally presented letters under two conditions of perceptual load. When perceptual load was high, distractors had no effect on selective attention, even with aversive conditioning. However, when perceptual load was low, strong response interference effects for CS+ face distractors were found for low trait-anxious participants. Across both experiments, this enhanced distractor interference reversed to strong facilitation effects for those reporting high trait anxiety. Thus, high trait-anxious participants were faster, rather than slower, when ignoring CS+ distractors. Using an attentional probe task in Experiment 3, it was found that fear conditioning resulted in strong attentional avoidance in a high trait-anxious group, which contrasted with enhanced vigilance in a low trait-anxious group. These results demonstrate that the impact of fear conditioning on attention is modulated by individual variation in trait anxiety when perceptual load is low. Fear conditioning elicits an avoidance of threat-relevant stimuli in high trait-anxious participants.

However, unrestricted/unmasked threat cues tend to delay the disengagement of attention, whereas restricted/masked threat facilitates orienting, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Within the general population, the serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5HTTLPR) is associated with one's allocation of attention to unmasked threat signals. However, it is unclear to what extent the 5HTTLPR gene may be involved in nonconscious biases to masked threat, and whether or not such biases are driven by facilitated orienting or delayed disengagement. Participants were genotyped and performed a dot-probe task with backward masked fearful and neutral faces. Results indicate that short-allele carriers of the 5HTTLPR gene nonconsciously orient spatial attention to masked fearful faces. On the other hand, homozygous long-allele individuals tended to direct attention away from masked fearful faces. All participants' performance was at chance in a posttask assessment of awareness for the masked faces. The results add to current literature on the 5HTTLPR and attention biases, and suggest that threat signals facilitate the orienting of attention in short-allele carriers of the 5HTTLPR gene even under restricted processing conditions.

Such individuals may show increased attentional bias following alcohol relative to nonclinical controls. The present study tested this hypothesis by examining acute alcohol effects on attentional bias in 20 social drinkers with ADHD and 20 social drinkers with no history of ADHD. Participants performed a visual-probe task after receiving the following doses of alcohol: 0.64g/kg, 0.32g/kg, and 0.0g/kg (placebo). Those in the ADHD group showed increased attentional bias under active alcohol doses, whereas attentional bias was similar across doses in the control group. Attentional bias predicted ad libitum alcohol consumption during a taste-rating session. This relation was observed only in the ADHD group. These findings indicate that an acute alcohol dose increases attentional bias in adults with ADHD.

Eighty heavy social drinkers (46 female) initially completed measures of automatic approach tendencies (stimulus response compatibility [SRC] task) and attentional bias (visual probe task) elicited by alcohol-related cues. Participants were then exposed to either an ego depletion manipulation or a control manipulation, before completing a bogus taste test in order to assess ad-lib alcohol consumption. In a subsequent testing session, we examined effects of the ego depletion manipulation (vs. control manipulation) on 3 aspects of executive function (inhibitory control, phonemic fluency, and delay discounting). Results indicated that the ego depletion manipulation increased ad-lib drinking, relative to the control manipulation. Automatic approach tendencies, but not attentional bias, predicted ad-lib drinking, although this effect was not moderated by ego depletion. Ego depletion had inconsistent effects on measures of executive function and impulsivity, and none of these measures mediated the effect of ego depletion on ad-lib drinking. However, the effect of ego depletion on ad-lib drinking was mediated by self-reported effort in suppressing emotion and thoughts during the manipulation.

Participants who were randomised to receive ABM reported less average (P = 0.001) and current pain (P = 0.008) and experienced pain for fewer days (P = 0.01) than those who received placebo.

After ABM, there was a significant group-by-time effect for disability. By 6-month follow-up, differences had emerged between the 2 training groups, such that the ABM group had shown greater reductions in anxiety sensitivity and disability than the placebo group. Although the results of these studies show that there is potential in the application of ABM to pain conditions, the mechanisms of treatment could not be established. Neither group showed an initial bias towards the word stimuli or a training effect, and only in the acute pain group were changes in biases related to outcome.

Recent Findings: CBM designed to change attentional selectivity has proven capable of modifying attentional biases associated with emotional dysfunction, pain disorders, eating disorders and addictions. CBM designed to change interpretive selectivity has proven capable of modifying the tendency to resolve ambiguity in a negative manner that is characteristic of emotional dysfunction. Recent research confirms that both forms of CBM can alter the severity of symptoms associated with psychopathology. Extended delivery of such CBM approaches now has been shown to yield therapeutic benefits for a range of anxiety disorders, and in the case of CBM-A has augmented the efficacy of treatment for alcohol dependence. Summary: CBM approaches have passed the proof-of-concept stage, and recent small-scale trials attest to their likely clinical value. There is a pressing need for large-scale randomized controlled trials, to compare the efficacy of CBM with that of alternative approaches, and to identify how CBM can most effectively be integrated into multimodal treatment programs. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","attentional bias modification; CBM; CBM-A; CBM-I; cognitive bias modification; interpretive bias modification","alcoholism; attention; body image; cognitive bias modification targeting attention; cognitive bias modification targeting interpretation; depression; diet restriction; eating disorder; emotion; emotional disorder; follow up; generalized anxiety disorder; human; mental disease; nociception; pain; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; social phobia; symptom; Alcoholism; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Cognitive Therapy; Emotions; Humans; Mental Disorders",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857060422

Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that D3 receptor antagonists may attenuate the motivational impact of rewarding cues. In this study we examined the acute effects of the D3 receptor antagonist GSK598809 on attentional bias to rewarding food cues in overweight to obese individuals (n=26, BMI mean=32.7±3.7, range 27-40 kg/m 2) who reported binge and emotional eating. We also determined whether individual differences in restrained eating style modulated the effects of GSK598809 on attentional bias. The study utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design with each participant tested following acute administration of placebo and GSK598809 (175 mg). Attentional bias was assessed by the visual probe task and modified Stroop task using food-related words. Overall GSK598809 had no effects on attentional bias in either the visual probe or food Stroop tasks. However, the effect of GSK598809 on both visual probe and food Stroop attentional bias scores was inversely correlated with a measure of eating restraint allowing the identification of two subpopulations, low-and high-restrained eaters. Low-restrained eaters had a significant attentional bias towards food cues in both tasks under placebo, and this was attenuated by GSK598809. In contrast, high-restrained eaters showed no attentional bias to food cues following either placebo or GSK598809. These findings suggest that excessive attentional bias to food cues generated by individual differences in eating traits can be modulated by D3 receptor antagonists, warranting further investigation with measures of eating behaviour and weight loss. © 2011 CINP.","Attentional bias; D 3 receptor; food; Stroop; visual probe task","dopamine 3 receptor blocking agent; gsk598809; n [4 [2 (6 cyano 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 2 isoquinolinyl)ethyl]cyclohexyl] 4 quinolinecarboxamide; placebo; unclassified drug; adult; article; attention; body mass; clinical article; clinical examination; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug effect; eating habit; emotional disorder; feeding behavior; female; human; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; palatability; priority journal; Stroop test; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Cross-Over Studies; Cues; Dopamine Antagonists; Double-Blind Method; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Photic Stimulation; Receptors, Dopamine D3; Stroop Test; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857346563

We previously reported that T treatment in rhesus monkeys undergoing chemically induced hypogonadism results in increased watching time of videos depicting fights between unfamiliar conspecifics (Lacreuse et al., 2010). In the current study, we aimed to further investigate the effect of T manipulations on attention and memory for emotional stimuli in male rhesus monkeys. Six males (7 years old) were administered Depot Lupron to suppress endogenous T levels and treated with either testosterone enanthate (TE, 5. mg/kg) or oil, before crossing over to the alternate treatment. Animals were tested for 16 weeks on two computerized touchscreen tasks with both social and nonsocial emotional and neutral stimuli. The Dot-Probe task was used to measure attention, and the Delayed-Non-Matching-to-Sample task with a 1. s delay (DNMS) was used to measure recognition memory for these stimuli. Performance on the two tasks was examined during each of four month-long phases: Baseline, Lupron alone, Lupron. +. TE and Lupron. +. oil. It was predicted that T administration would lead to increased attention to negative social stimuli (i.e., negative facial expressions of unfamiliar conspecifics) and would improve memory for such stimuli. We found no evidence to support these predictions. In the Dot-Probe task, an attentional bias towards negative social stimuli was observed at baseline, but T treatment did not enhance this bias. Instead, monkeys had faster response times when treated with T compared to oil, independently of the emotional valence or social relevance of stimuli, perhaps reflecting an enhancing effect of T on reward sensitivity or general arousal. In the DNMS, animals had better memory for nonsocial compared to social stimuli and showed the poorest performance in the recognition of positive facial expressions. However, T did not affect performance on the task. Thus, even though monkeys were sensitive to the social relevance and emotional valence of the stimuli in the two tasks, T manipulations had no effect on attention or memory for these stimuli. Because habituation to the stimuli may have mitigated the effect of treatment in the attentional task, we suggest that T may increase attentional biases to negative social stimuli only during early exposure to the stimuli with acute treatment or when stimuli are highly arousing (i.e., dynamically presented) with chronic treatment. In addition, the data suggest that T does not enhance working memory for emotional stimuli in young male macaques. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Androgens; Arousal; Cognition; Emotion; Macaque","leuprorelin; oil; testosterone; testosterone enantate; affect; animal experiment; arousal; article; attention; clinical assessment; controlled study; crossing over; Delayed Non Matching to Sample task; Dot Probe task; emotion; facial expression; hormone inhibition; male; nonhuman; priority journal; recognition; response time; reward; rhesus monkey; social behavior; stimulus response; task performance; working memory; Animals; Attention; Facial Expression; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Leuprolide; Macaca mulatta; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Testosterone",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856561028

Depressed individuals have high levels of cortisol, and exhibit an attentional bias toward a depression-related stimulus and impaired processing speed and executive attention, which are components of attentional function. Therefore, the study tested the hypotheses that an acute increase in cortisol in response to a stressor is associated with attentional bias toward a depression-related stimulus and impaired processing speed and executive attention. Thirty-six participants were administered the dot-probe task for the measurement of attentional bias toward a depression-related stimulus and the Trail Making Test A and B for the measurement of processing speed and executive attention before and after a mental arithmetic task. It was revealed that attentional bias toward a depression-related stimulus following the stressor was observed only among the responders (i.e., participants with cortisol elevation in response to a stressor). On the other hand, no differences in the performance of processing speed and executive attention were noted between the responders and non-responders. The results indicate that acutely elevated cortisol is related to attentional bias, but is not related to processing speed and executive attention.

Attention biases to threat and abnormalities in fear learning and extinction are processes likely to play a critical role in the creation and/or maintenance of PTSD symptomatology. However, the relationship between these processes has not been established, particularly in highly traumatized populations; understanding their interaction can help inform neural network models and treatments for PTSD.Method Attention biases were measured using a dot probe task modified for use with our population; task stimuli included photographs of angry facial expressions, which are emotionally salient threat signals. A fear-potentiated startle paradigm was employed to measure atypical physiological response during acquisition and extinction phases of fear learning. These measures were administered to a sample of 64 minority (largely African American), highly traumatized individuals with and without PTSD.Results Participants with PTSD demonstrated attention biases toward threat; this attentional style was associated with exaggerated startle response during fear learning and early and middle phases of extinction, even after accounting for the effects of trauma exposure.Conclusions Our findings indicate that an attentional bias toward threat is associated with abnormalities in 'fear load' in PTSD, providing seminal evidence for an interaction between these two processes. Future research combining these behavioral and psychophysiological techniques with neuroimaging will be useful toward addressing how one process may modulate the other and understanding whether these phenomena are manifestations of dysfunction within a shared neural network. Ultimately, this may serve to inform PTSD treatments specifically designed to correct these atypical processes. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","Attention bias; extinction; fear; PTSD; startle; threat","adolescent; adult; African American; analysis of variance; article; attention; case control study; child; conditioned reflex; facial expression; fear; female; human; life event; male; middle aged; nerve cell network; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological aspect; reinforcement; startle reflex; urban population; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Child; Conditioning, Classical; Extinction, Psychological; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Net; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Startle Reaction; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Urban Population; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856044293

In the real world, explicit instructions are not always available and presumably expectations shaped by previous experience play an important role in the allocation of these processes. Here we examined whether manipulating two experiential factors that clearly influence saccade preparation-the probability and timing of saccadic responses-also influences the allocation of visuospatial attention. Occasionally, a visual probe was presented whose spatial location and time of presentation varied relative to those of the saccade target. The proportion of erroneous saccades directed toward this probe indexed saccade preparation, and the proportion of correct discriminations of probe orientation indexed visuospatial attention. Overall, preparation and attention were significantly correlated to each other across these manipulations of saccade probability and timing. Saccade probability influenced both preparation and attention processes, whereas saccade timing influenced only preparation processes. Unexpectedly, discrimination ability was not improved in those trials in which the probe triggered an erroneous saccade despite particularly heightened levels of saccade preparation. To account for our results, we propose a conceptual dual-purpose threshold model based on neurophysiological considerations that link the processes of saccade preparation and visuospatial attention. The threshold acts both as the minimum activity level required for eliciting saccades and a maximum level for which neural activity can provide attentional benefits. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Oculomotor capture; Response probability; Visual discrimination","adult; article; conceptual framework; depth perception; female; human; male; neurophysiology; orienting response; perceptive threshold; priority journal; saccadic eye movement; visual discrimination; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Saccades; Space Perception; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857324268

However, the neurophysiological underpinnings of this bias are not fully understood. To contribute to a better understanding of the processing bias for threat, both event-related potential (ERP) and event-related oscillation (ERO) analyses were applied to the electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from subjects while performing a go/no-go variant of the dot-probe task. In the task, subjects responded to the infrequent target stimuli and didn't respond to the standard stimuli. Both target and standard stimuli were preceded by a bilateral picture pair [one emotional (threatening or pleasant) and one neutral] as an emotional cue. The behavioral data and the P1 elicited by standard stimuli didn't show any significant main effect or interaction. The mean amplitude of N1 was greater negative for threatening cues than pleasant cues with the most significant effect in the fronto-central region, indicating a processing bias for threat related to early attention processing. In addition, the theta synchronization was stronger for threatening cues than pleasant cues with significant effect in posterior regions, suggesting that the posterior theta synchronization reflects the evaluation of emotional significance of stimuli.

Attention biases have been studied in relation to a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) offering equivocal findings. The present meta-analysis tested whether the extant published data support the notion that variation in the 5-HTTLPR genotype modulates selective attention to negative information. Methods: Eleven relevant samples from 10 published articles were identified through a systematic literature search (total n = 807). Relevant attention bias and 5-HTTLPR data were extracted based on specific coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size index was used to calculate all outcome measures. Publication bias was assessed using various methods. Results: Carriers of the low (SS, SL G, L GL G) transmission efficacy genotype display attentional vigilance toward negatively valenced stimuli, a pattern not found in the intermediate (SL A, L AL G) and high (L AL A) efficacy genotypes. This phenomenon emerges as of medium effect size. Conclusions: The meta-analysis supports the notion that allele variants of the 5-HTTLPR are associated with selective attention to negative stimuli. More studies are needed to fully establish the consistency of this effect. Future studies applying systematic attention bias modification may shed further light on the role of 5-HTTLPR in the development of anxiety disorders and in the prediction of clinical response to attention bias modification treatments. © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","5-HTTLPR; Anxiety; attention bias; gene; serotonin; threat","serotonin transporter; anxiety disorder; article; attention; DNA polymorphism; emotion; genetic variability; genotype; human; information; meta analysis; priority journal; promoter region; PsycINFO; systematic review; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Behavior Therapy; Catastrophization; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Prognosis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Serotonin; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855993012

Elevated negative affectivity was found to be associated with both increased attentional engagement with, and impaired attentional disengagement from, negative information, especially when this was anxiety relevant. In contrast, attenuated positive affectivity was associated with facilitated attentional disengagement from negative information, especially when this was depression relevant.

To address this issue, 49 non-anxious adults were randomly assigned to either attentional training toward or training away from threat using a modified version of the dot probe task. Behavioral measures of attentional biases were also generated pre- and post-training using the dot probe task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were generated to threat and non-threat face pairs and probes during pre- and post-training assessments. Effects of training on behavioral measures of the threat bias were significant, but only for those participants showing pre-training biases. Attention training also influenced early spatial attention, as measured by post-training P1 amplitudes to cues.

In the current study, implicit attentional bias to smoking-related cues was investigated in college-age smokers, based on models of addiction that suggest that attention to drug-related cues plays an important role in drug addiction. Sixty-one participants completed a dot-probe task to measure attentional bias to smoking-related and matched non-smoking-related control pictures.

Previous research has been limited by the almost exclusive reliance on behavioural response times to experimental tasks to provide an index of attentional biases. The current study evaluated the relationship between the time-course of attention and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. Forty-two young adults completed a dot-probe task with emotional faces while eyemovement data were collected. The results revealed that increased social anxiety was associated with attention to emotional (rather than neutral) faces over time as well as difficulty disengaging attention from angry expressions; some evidence was found for a relationship between heightened depressive symptoms and increased attention to fear faces. © 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.","Attention; Depression; Disengagement; Dot-probe; Eye-tracking; Social anxiety; Vigilance","adult; anger; article; attention; clinical article; depression; emotion; eye tracking; fear; female; happiness; human; male; priority journal; social phobia; Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention; Depression; Emotions; Eye Movements; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Social Behavior; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857280878

Overall, individuals with chronic pain were found to show significantly greater bias towards pain-related information compared to controls, with an effect size of .36 (Hedges' adjusted g). The time-course of attentional bias was also explored, with evidence found for significant bias during stages of initial orienting of attention (effect size .29) and maintained attention (effect size .42). Bias therefore appears more pronounced during later stages of attention, possibly arising from processes of rumination.

In the current study, 73 participants (54.79% female) completed an emotion face dot-probe task followed by a recognition memory test. Compared to participants with SAD, participants with comorbid SAD and MDD oriented away from supraliminally presented angry faces. Subsequently, SAD participants with and without comorbidity recognized fewer angry faces than non-disordered controls. Furthermore, attention biases for subliminally presented stimuli predicted recognition accuracy only for comorbid participants.

This response is so powerful that modulations in spatial attention can occur automatically without conscious awareness. Functional neuroimaging research suggests that the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) form a network involved in the rapid orienting of attention to threat. A hyper-responsive attention bias to threat is a common component of anxiety disorders. Yet, little is known of how individual differences in underlying brain morphometry relate to variability in attention bias to threat. Here, we performed two experiments using dot-probe tasks that measured individuals' attention bias to backward masked fearful faces. We collected whole-brain structural magnetic resonance images and used voxel-based morphometry to measure brain morphometry. We tested the hypothesis that reduced gray matter within the amygdala and ACC would be associated with reduced attention bias to threat. In Experiment 1, we found that backward masked fearful faces captured spatial attention and that elevated attention bias to masked threat was associated with greater ACC gray matter volumes. In Experiment 2, this association was replicated in a separate sample. Thus, we provide initial and replicating evidence that ACC gray matter volume is correlated with biased attention to threat. Importantly, we demonstrate that variability in affective attention bias within the healthy population is associated with ACC morphometry. This result opens the door for future research into the underlying brain morphometry associated with attention bias in clinically anxious populations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Attention bias; Backward masking; Cingulate; Faces; Fear; Nonconscious; Spatial attention; Subliminal","adult; amygdaloid nucleus; anterior cingulate; article; attention; attention bias to threat; behavior; brain region; brain size; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; functional neuroimaging; gray matter; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pattern recognition; priority journal; replication study; spatial orientation; task performance; threat; voxel based morphometry; Adult; Attention; Fear; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Male; Neurons; Statistics as Topic; Unconscious (Psychology); Young Adult","BCS-0643348, NSF, National Science Foundation; BCS-0921565, NSF, National Science Foundation; #N0014-04-1-005, ONR, Office of Naval Research; W911NF1110246, ARO, Army Research Office","Research was supported by National Science Foundation grants BCS-0643348 and BCS-0921565 awarded to Eddie Harmon-Jones Office of Naval Research grant #N0014-04-1-005 awarded to Lilianne Mujica-Parodi, and Army Research Office Grant W911NF1110246 awarded to Lilianne Mujica-Parodi and Joshua Carlson.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-83055194241

Method: From a target sample of 186 treatment-seeking children at a hospital-based child anxiety clinic, 40 patients with an ongoing anxiety disorder who met all inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: ABM designed to shift attention away from threat; placebo attention training using stimuli identical to those in the ABM condition; and placebo attention training using only neutral stimuli. All participants completed four weekly 480-trial sessions (1,920 total trials). Before and after the attention training sessions, children's clinical status was determined via semistructured interviews and questionnaires. Reduction in the number of anxiety symptoms and their severity was compared across the three groups. Results: Change in the number of anxiety symptoms and their severity differed across the three conditions. This reflected significant reductions in the number of anxiety symptoms and symptom severity in the ABM condition but not in the placebo attention training or placebo-neutral condition.

In addition, we questioned whether an attentional bias towards food-associated cues can be observed in an early stage of information processing.Design:Control-group study including the administration of behavioural tasks (that is, go/no-go task with food-associated and neutral words, visual dot probe task with food-associated and neutral pictures) and self-reported measures of eating behaviour and impulsivity.Results:Although self-reported measures indicated disinhibition of eating behaviour of obese patients, we found that food-associated stimuli induced an impairment of inhibitory control in both obese participants as well as normal-weight controls. Results from the visual dot-probe task indicated that food-associated cues did not modulate attention allocation in a very early stage of information processing, which suggests that the incentive salience of food-associated stimuli might be lower than that of drug-associated cues.Conclusion:These findings are not in line with hypotheses derived from models of addictive behaviour and call into question that an impairment of inhibitory control in response to food-associated cues and salience attribution might be at the core of obesity.

However,the mechanisms involved in transmission of risk are uncertain. Cognitive models of anxiety propose thatinformation-processing biases underlie anxiety vulnerability; in particular, attentional biases for threat.Consequently, this study examined attentional biases in mothers with lifetime PD and their daughters(aged 9-14 years). Sixty mother-daughter dyads (n = 120) were recruited to the study; half the mothershad lifetime PD (i.e., either a current or past history of PD), and half had no psychiatric history.Attentional biases were assessed using a visual-probe task with pictorial and word stimuli related tophysical-health threat. Stimulus duration was varied to examine the time-course of attentional biases(initial orienting and maintained attention). Results showed an attentional bias for threat in daughters ofmothers with lifetime PD, compared with daughters of mothers with no PD history. Specifically, at-riskdaughters had an attentional bias for physical-health threat cues (words and pictures) at the longerstimulus duration of 1250 ms (but not at 500 ms). In addition, attentional bias for threat in girls wasassociated with increased physical-health threat worries. Mothers with lifetime PD did not significantlydiffer from mothers with no PD history on the indices of attentional bias. The findings are discussed interms of an attentional threat-monitoring strategy in at-risk girls and argue against the view that there issimple transmission of an anxiety-related attentional processing style across generations. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Attentional bias; Children; Panic disorder; Parents; Threat","adolescent; adult; article; association; child; daughter; disease association; family history; female; human; medical history; neurologic examination; panic; psychologic assessment; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; scoring system; selective attention; task performance; threat; visual orientation; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873894961

The use of ABM to reduce potentially toxic biases, for instance, is a newly emerging therapy for anxiety disorders. A separate line of gene-by-environment interaction research proposes that many so-called vulnerability genes or risk alleles are better seen as plasticity genes, as they seem to make individuals more susceptible to environmental influences for better and for worse. Methods: A standard ABM procedure was used with a sample of 116 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. One received an ABM procedure designed to induce a bias in attention toward negative material, while the other was trained toward positive pictures. Individuals with low- and high-expressing forms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were compared. Results: Those with a low-expression form (S/S, S/Lg, or Lg/Lg) of the 5-HTTLPR gene developed stronger biases for both negative and positive affective pictures relative to those with the high-expression (La/La) form of the gene. Conclusions: Here, we report the first evidence that allelic variation in the promotor region of the 5-HTTLPR gene predicts different degrees of sensitivity to ABM. These results suggest a potential cognitive mechanism for the gene-by-environment interactions that have been found in relation to the serotonin transporter gene. Variation on this genotype may therefore determine who will benefit most (and least) from therapeutic interventions, adversity, and supportive environments. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Anxiety; attention bias modification; cognitive bias; genetics; GxE interaction; serotonin transporter gene","serotonin transporter; adult; allele; anxiety disorder; article; attention disturbance; audiovisual equipment; cognition; controlled study; executive function; female; gene expression; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; human; human tissue; male; medical research; normal human; phenotypic plasticity; priority journal; promoter region; selective attention; sensitivity analysis; Adult; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Emotions; Environment; Female; Genotype; Humans; Male; Pain Measurement; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80155208643

The aim of the present study was to provide some data on the psychometric properties of the dot-probe paradigm in the context of pain-related research. Using the data of a large pain-free sample and a large chronic pain sample, the present study examined the psychometric properties of a picture- and word-based dot-probe task. It also examined the data of idiosyncratically selected stimuli designed to be relevant to each participant and compared this with the data of neutral stimuli and nonsalient pain-related stimuli. Poor levels of internal consistency (α range: -.44 to.28; split-half r range: -.35 to.11) and test-retest reliability (r range: -.14 to.13) were found among the pain-free sample, irrespective of the task used or the stimuli used. There was limited evidence of comparability between the 2 tasks among the chronic pain sample (r range: -.08 to.26) and similarly poor levels of internal-consistency (α range: -.56 to.17; split-half r range: -.20 to.25). The findings of the present study therefore suggest that psychometric issues may be important to pain-related attentional bias research. More research is, however, undoubtedly needed.

Attentional biases to emotional face stimuli were assessed in 34 college students (17 women) using the dot-probe task during counterbalanced conditions of moderate- (heart rate at 45% peak oxygen consumption) and high-intensity exercise (heart rate at 80% peak oxygen consumption) compared with seated rest. The dot-probe task consisted of 1 emotional face (pleasant or unpleasant) paired with a neutral face for 1,000 ms; 256 trials (128 trials for each valence) were presented during each condition. Each condition lasted approximately 10 min. Participants were instructed to perform each trial of the dot-probe task as quickly and accurately as possible during the exercise and rest conditions. During moderate-intensity exercise, participants exhibited significantly greater attentional bias scores to pleasant compared with unpleasant faces (p < .01), whereas attentional bias scores to emotional faces did not differ at rest or during high-intensity exercise (p > .05). In addition, the attentional bias to unpleasant faces was significantly reduced during moderate-intensity exercise compared with that during rest (p < .05). These results provide behavioral evidence that during exercise at a moderate intensity, there is a shift in attention allocation toward pleasant emotional stimuli and away from unpleasant emotional stimuli.

Behaviorally, both groups displayed a small advantage in response time to targets in the location of a previous emotional word cue, independent of its emotional valence. The event-related electrical response to threat-neutral word cue pairs showed enhanced occipital P1 amplitudes in the high relative to the low AS group. In contrast, low AS participants displayed greater P1 amplitude to positive-neutral word cue pairs compared to threat-neutral ones. Selective threat-related modulations also affected a later occipital P2, in response to the cued words, in the high AS group.More importantly, the event-related response to targets following the emotional word cue pairs showed modulations as a function of trait-anxiety, spatial location, and emotion. In the high AS group, an occipital N1 wave was increased in response to probe targets in the same location as previous presented threat versus positive words. In contrast, in the low AS group, occipital N1 amplitudes were decreased in response to probe targets following threat word cues relative to neutral word cues, independent of validity. In addition, over parietal scalp, N1 amplitude to threat invalid trials was increased relative to threat valid trials.Voltage of the later P3b wave also varied as a function of AS group, spatial location, and emotion. In the high AS group, P3b was attenuated for probe targets in the same location as previously presented threat words than to probe targets in the same location as positive words. In the low AS group, P3b to probes were reduced following positive relative to threat word cues, independent of validity. The present results in the dot-probe task are interpreted within a model in which early hypervigilance to threat in high trait anxiety leads to early enhancement of occipitally distributed sensory components (P1 to the threat pairs, N1 to following probe targets) and later attenuation of conscious top-down processing of threat stimuli (as indexed by the P3b). In contrast, low trait anxiety is accompanied by early attenuation of occipitally distributed sensory components (P1 to the threat cue pairs, N1 to following targets). © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the present study, attentional processes (i.e., facilitated engagement, difficulty disengaging) underlying the association between ATB and PTSS were examined. Additionally, attentional control (AC) was examined as a moderator of this relationship. Participants (N= 97) completed a dot-probe task with two levels of stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA: 150 and 500 ms). Higher PTSS were associated with ATB when SOA was longer (i.e., 500 ms), suggesting difficulty disengaging from threat stimuli. AC moderated the relationship between PTSS and ATB when SOA was shorter (i.e., 150 ms), with participants high in PTSS and high in AC having disengaged and shifted attention from threat stimuli using top-down AC when the emotional valence of threat stimuli was less salient (i.e., shorter presentation duration). Findings implicate AC as a buffering mechanism against prolonged attentional engagement with threat-related stimuli among those with high PTSS.

Evidence supports the influence of individual difference variables such as anxiety sensitivity, pain-related anxiety, and catastrophizing on the pain experience and on pain-related attentional biases. Changes in attentional biases have been associated with treatment gains in patients with clinically significant anxiety. The Attentional Modification Paradigm (AMP) is a modification of the dot-probe paradigm used to facilitate such changes in attentional biases. Given the relationship between chronic musculoskeletal pain and anxiety, AMP may be effective in reducing pain as well. Participants included persons (n = 17) with fibromyalgia and were randomly assigned to either an AMP condition or a control condition. The participants completed two 15-minute AMP sessions per week for 4 weeks. Those in the AMP condition reported statistically significant and substantial reductions on several individual difference variables relative to those in the control condition, and a greater proportion experienced clinically significant reductions in pain.

In the primary task, the subjects needed to accomplish the whole dynamic process of flight simulation in a flight simulator, including take off, cruise and landing. During the process of flight simulation, subjects needed to monitor the information targets presented in the simulation model of head-up display (HUD) and made a response to abnormal information. The mental workload was manipulated by setting the quantities and refresh frequencies of the target information to be responded. The secondary task was the visual probes task under the oddball paradigm. 30 Electroencephalographic (EEG) activities were recorded simultaneously. The experiment results revealed that with the increase of primary task difficulty, the accuracy rates of the primary and secondary tasks were both decrease, as well as the reaction times were extended. The main effect of mental workload was significant to the peak amplitude and peak latency of P300, showing that under the high mental workload, the P300 peak amplitude decreased and the peak latency extended compared to that of the low mental workload. The results suggested that P300 component was sensitive to the flight task-irrelevant mental workload, and it might provide some effective electrophysiological evidence for mental workload evaluation in complex flight tasks. © 2011 IEEE.","attention; ergonomics; flight simulation; mental workload; P300","Accuracy rate; attention; Dual-tasks; Dynamic process; Flight simulation; Head up displays; Main effect; Mental workload; Oddball paradigms; P300; Peak amplitude; Primary task; Simulation model; Target information; Biomedical engineering; Computer simulation; Display devices; Electrophysiology; Ergonomics; Information science; Reaction rates; Flight simulators",,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855811126

However, previous randomized trials have not systematically examined the combination of CBM for attention (CBM-A) and interpretation (CBM-I) or the credibility and acceptability of these protocols. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (N = 32) to examine the efficacy of a CBM treatment called Attention and Interpretation Modification (AIM) for SAD. AIM comprised eight, twice weekly computer sessions with no therapist contact. During AIM, participants (1) completed a dot probe task in which probes always followed neutral faces when paired with a disgust face, thereby directing attention away from threat and (2) completed a word-sentence association task in which they received positive feedback for making benign interpretations of word-sentence pairs and negative feedback for making negative interpretations. We also assessed participants' perceived credibility of and satisfaction with AIM. Results: Participants receiving AIM reported significantly reduced self-reported (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) symptoms of social anxiety relative to the placebo. These gains were also evident on a behavioral measure (performance on an impromptu speech). AIM met our benchmarks for credibility and acceptability in this community sample, although credibility ratings were modest. Participants reported that CBM-I was more helpful than CBM-A. Conclusions: A combined CBM treatment produced medium-to-large effects on social anxiety. Participants rated AIM as moderately credibly and acceptable. Should these findings be replicated in larger samples, AIM has the potential to be a widely accessible and efficacious treatment for SAD.

We previously reported that crude threat cues (backward masked fearful faces) facilitate spatial attention through a network of brain regions consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate and contralateral visual cortex. However, results from previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dot-probe studies have been inconclusive regarding a fearful face-elicited contralateral modulation of visual targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the capture of spatial attention by crude threat cues would facilitate processing of subsequently presented visual stimuli within the masked fearful face-elicited 'spotlight of attention' in the contralateral visual cortex. Participants performed a backward masked fearful face dot-probe task while brain activity was measured with fMRI. Masked fearful face left visual field trials enhanced activity for spatially congruent targets in the right superior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus and lateral occipital complex, while masked fearful face right visual field trials enhanced activity in the left middle occipital gyrus. These data indicate that crude threat elicited spatial attention enhances the processing of subsequent visual stimuli in contralateral occipital cortex, which may occur by lowering neural activation thresholds in this retinotopic location. © The Author (2010).

This study investigated one potential mechanism-attentional bias to cocaine imagery following trauma cue exposure. Design Male and female cocaine-dependent in-patients with and without PTSD were exposed to both a neutral and personalized trauma script on separate days, followed by a visual dot-probe task. A 2 (PTSD versus non-PTSD)×2 (neutral versus trauma script)×2 (male versus female) design was used to examine hypotheses. Setting Participants were recruited from a residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment center. Participants Participants were 60 trauma-exposed cocaine dependent in-patients, 30 with current PTSD and 30 without a history of PTSD. Measurements Attentional bias was assessed using a visual dot-probe task depicting cocaine-related imagery following both a neutral script and personalized trauma script. Findings Following neutral script exposure, PTSD (versus non-PTSD) participants exhibited an attentional bias away from cocaine imagery. This effect was reversed following trauma script exposure, with PTSD participants exhibiting a greater attentional bias towards the location of cocaine imagery than non-PTSD participants. Severity of subjective distress following trauma script exposure predicted level of attentional bias among PTSD participants. Conclusions Cocaine appears to serve an emotion-regulating function among post-traumatic stress disorder patients and may be a potential target for brief post-traumatic stress disorder-substance use disorder interventions that can facilitate residential substance use disorder treatment retention. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Attentional bias cocaine; Comorbidity; Emotion regulation; Substance use disorder; Traumatic exposure","adaptive behavior; adult; article; association; attention; cocaine dependence; comorbidity; drug dependence treatment; emotion; female; hospitalization; human; life event; male; methodology; patient compliance; photostimulation; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological aspect; sex difference; statistical analysis; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Attention; Cocaine-Related Disorders; Comorbidity; Cues; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Emotions; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Patient Compliance; Photic Stimulation; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Substance Abuse Treatment Centers",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052750537

The effect of the OPRM1 c.118A>G polymorphism, associated with liking and wanting, and the DRD4-VNTR polymorphism, related to wanting, on the relation between attentional bias and alcohol use was investigated. Methods: A total of 195 young adolescents (Study 1) and 86 young adult male heavy drinkers (Study 2) completed a visual probe test. Saliva samples were collected to test both polymorphisms. Results: In Study 1, attentional bias was positively associated with adolescent alcohol use only for OPRM1 G-allele carriers. In Study 2, attentional bias was positively associated with problem drinking for carriers of a DRD4 long allele. Discussion: It is tentatively proposed that an attentional bias for alcohol is related most strongly to liking and wanting in early adolescents, while in young adults, an attentional bias may reflect wanting. In addition, individual differences associated with two both genetic markers should be taken into account when examining the relation between attentional bias and alcohol use. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescence; Alcohol use; Cognitive processes; Genetic polymorphisms; Individual differences; Young adulthood","dopamine 4 receptor; mu opiate receptor; adolescent; age distribution; alcohol abuse; alcohol consumption; article; attention; behavior change; child; controlled study; DNA polymorphism; DRD4 gene; female; gene; gene frequency; gene function; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genotype; human; internal bias; male; OPRM1 gene; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; stimulus response; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alleles; Attention; Child; Heterozygote Detection; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, Dopamine D4; Receptors, Opioid, mu; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052782357

Chief among the measures of attentional bias is the visual probe task, which requires the ability to respond quickly and fixate on objects. Alcohol is well recognized for impairing both of these abilities, which could undermine the reliable detection of attentional bias in intoxicated individuals. The purpose of the present study was to determine if attentional bias toward alcohol-related images can still be observed under alcohol even at blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) sufficient to disrupt reaction time (RT) and basic ocular functions. Methods: The present study employed a within-subject design to test the effects of three doses of alcohol (0.0. g/kg, 0.32. g/kg, and 0.64. g/kg) on attentional bias toward alcohol-related images in a group of 20 social drinkers using a visual probe task. Alcohol's effects on simple RT and ocular functions were also assessed. Results: Attentional bias was observed by participants' fixations toward alcohol-related stimuli following alcohol administration. Alcohol also impaired oculomotor functions as evident by decreased accuracy and speed of saccades. Discussion: The findings indicate that attentional bias can be detected even at BACs above 80. mg/100. ml that disrupt oculomotor functions that are considered fundamental to visual search tasks. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Alcohol; Attentional bias; Visual probe task","alcohol; accuracy; adult; alcohol blood level; alcohol intoxication; article; concentration response; controlled study; drinking behavior; eye fixation; eye movement control; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; response time; saccadic eye movement; selective attention; task performance; visual discrimination; visual stimulation; volunteer; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Intoxication; Attention; Automobile Driving; Central Nervous System Depressants; Ethanol; Eye; Female; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Saccades; Software; Time Factors; Young Adult","NIH, National Institutes of Health; NIAAA, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism","This research was supported by grants R01 AA012895 and R01 AA018274 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism .

Neutral photographs were paired with socially rewarding or aversive stimuli during conditioning; a dot-probe task then assessed biases in attention orienting.

Specifically, it was tested whether attention allocation processes toward high-fat foods differ between overweight and normal weight individuals and whether selective attention biases for food cues are related to craving and food intake. Method: Eye movements were recorded as a direct index of attention allocation in a sample of 22 overweight/obese and 29 healthy-weight female students during a visual probe task with food pictures. In addition, self-reported craving and actual food intake during a bogus "" taste-test"" were assessed. Results: Overweight participants showed an approach-avoidance pattern of attention allocation toward high-fat food. Overweight participants directed their first gaze more often toward food pictures than healthy-weight individuals, but subsequently showed reduced maintenance of attention on these pictures. For overweight participants, craving was related to initial orientation toward food. Moreover, overweight participants consumed significantly more snack food than healthy-weight participants.

Facial emotion perception in schizophrenia: a meta-analytic review. Schizophr. Bull. 36, 1009-1019). Recent evidence suggests context information can affect facial emotion recognition (Aviezer, H., Bentin, S., Hassin, R.R., Meschino, W.S., Kennedy, J., Grewal, S., Esmail, S., Cohen, S., Moscovitch, M., 2009. Not on the face alone: perception of contextualized face expressions in Huntington's disease. Brain 132, 1633-1644). Thus, individuals with schizophrenia may have deficits in facial emotion processing, at least in part, due to impairments in processing context information (Green, M.J., Waldron, J.H., Coltheart, M., 2007. Emotional context processing is impaired in schizophrenia. Cogn. Neuropsychiatry 12, 259-280.). We used a novel experimental task, the Emotion Context Processing Task (ECPT) to examine the influences of emotional context (IAPS pictures) on the processing of subtle surprised faces in schizophrenia. One of the task conditions included a manipulation designed to determine whether enhancing attention to the context (by requiring a categorization judgment on the context pictures) would facilitate the influence of context on facial emotion processing in schizophrenia. In addition, we tested whether deficits on a non-social context processing would predict deficits in the influence of context on facial emotion processing in schizophrenia. We administered the Dot Probe Expectancy Task (a non-social context processing task) and the ECPT to individuals with schizophrenia (n = 35) and healthy controls (n = 32). Individuals with schizophrenia showed an intact influence of context information on facial emotion recognition. The manipulation designed to enhance attention to emotional context reduced the effect of context for both groups. In schizophrenia, better processing of non-social context was associated with a stronger influence of context on valence ratings of facial expressions in the negative context condition. These results suggest in schizophrenia, similar mechanisms may influence the processing of context for both social and non-social information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Emotional context processing; Face recognition; Schizophrenia","adult; analytic method; analytical parameters; article; attention; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; emotion; facial expression; female; human; information processing; male; mental function; mental performance; pattern recognition; perceptive discrimination; priority journal; schizophrenia; scoring system; social environment; task performance; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mood Disorders; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051787884

As a result, attention bias modification (ABM) protocols have been employed as treatments for anxious adults. However, they have yet to emerge for children. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted to examine the efficacy of an ABM protocol designed to facilitate attention disengagement from threats, thereby reducing anxiety and stress vulnerability in children. Methods: Participants were 34 chronically high-anxious 10-year-olds. An emotional attention spatial cueing task was used. In the ABM condition (n = 18), threat faces never cued the targets' locations, such that the valid-invalid ratio was 0%/100%, respectively. The valid-invalid ratio on neutral cue trials was 25%/75%, respectively. In the control condition, the valid-invalid ratio was 25%/75% for both neutral and threat faces. Anxiety and depression were measured pre- and post-training and pre- and post-stress induction. Results: ABM facilitated attention disengagement from threat. In response to the stressor task, children in the ABM condition reported less state anxiety relative to controls.

As expected, highly test anxious persons reported an attentional bias towards threat stimuli under the high performance-evaluation threat condition only, consistent with a switch from an avoidant to a vigilant mode of processing. Under the low performance-evaluation threat condition, both high and low test anxious persons showed a bias away from threat stimuli. These findings suggest that test anxiety, like clinical and high trait anxiety is also characterised by attentional bias where a disproportionate amount of attentional resource is directed towards corresponding threat (i.e. test-related) stimuli. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Attentional bias; Performance-evaluation threat; Test anxiety",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960009777

Little is known about observers' attentional processing of another's pain. The present study investigated, within a sample of parents (n = 65; 51 mothers, 14 fathers) of school children, parental selective attention to children's facial display of pain and the moderating role of child's facial expressiveness of pain and parental catastrophizing about their child's pain. Parents performed a dot-probe task in which child facial display of pain (of varying pain expressiveness) were presented. Findings provided evidence of parental selective attention to child pain displays. Low facial displays of pain appeared sufficiently and also, as compared with higher facial displays of pain, equally capable of engaging parents' attention to the location of threat. Severity of facial displays of pain had a nonspatial effect on attention; that is, there was increased interference (ie, delayed responding) with increasing facial expressiveness. This interference effect was particularly pronounced for high-catastrophizing parents, suggesting that being confronted with increasing child pain displays becomes particularly demanding for high-catastrophizing parents. Finally, parents with higher levels of catastrophizing increasingly attended away from low pain expressions, whereas selective attention to high-pain expressions did not differ between high-catastrophizing and low-catastrophizing parents. Theoretical implications and further research directions are discussed. Parental attentional processing of child pain is dependent on parental catastrophizing about the child's pain, child facial expressiveness of pain, and the interaction between the two. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected from 24 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 never-depressed individuals (ND) during a dot-probe task, using pairs of affectively valenced pictures as cues. Cue presentation time was either 100 ms or 500 ms. Results: When the cue presentation time was 500 ms, bias scores for positive-neutral picture pairs (POS-NEU) were negative for the MDD group and positive for the ND group which means ND individuals were able to successfully select positive information. These behavioral effects were supported by ERP results. In the ND group, at the right parietal-occipital region, P1 amplitude during valid POS-NEU pairs was significantly larger than that during invalid POS-NEU pairs; this pattern did not appear in the MDD group. Conclusions: These results suggest that MDD patients are characterized by a deficit in protection bias, meaning that these participants cannot avoid attending to negative information in their environment, but only when negative stimuli are presented for a sufficient period of time.

Based on eye movement assessments, short presentation times of stimuli have been proposed to investigate initial attentional processes. However, it remains unclear if eye movements contribute to anxiety related biases as measured in dot probe tasks when presentation times below 200 ms are used. In this study the electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded in a sample of 17 participants with social phobia and 13 controls performing a visual dot probe task in two presentation time conditions. In the 175 ms condition, half of the participants moved their eyes in only 10% of the trials. Significantly more participants moved their eyes in the 600 ms condition and individuals with social phobia directed their gaze more often to the threat faces than to the neutral faces. Eye movement measures were not related to reaction time measures but the number of initial eye movements towards threatening faces correlated with measures of social anxiety. For dot probe paradigms, the additional use of eye movement measures seems to be particularly appropriate for longer presentation times. The dissociation between attentional bias scores as measured with reaction time versus eye movement measures and their relation to different presentation times underlines the need for both measures when conducting visual probe studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In two experiments we found robust physiological and infjective effects of the CO2 inhalation consistent with the claim that the procedure reliably induces anxiety. Data from the dot-probe task demonstrated an attentional bias to emotional facial expressions compared with neutral faces regardless of valence (happy, angry, and fearful). These attentional effects, however, were entirely inconsistent in terms of their relationship with induced anxiety.

The primary aim of the present study was to examine whether 2 stimulus-related factors may be important to the detection of pain-related attentional biases: 1) the personal relevance of stimuli; and 2) their ecological validity. To do this, the present research compared the ability of a word-based dot-probe task (ie, lower ecological validity) and picture-based dot-probe task (ie, higher ecological validity) to detect attentional biases using generally selected (ie, lower personal relevance) and idiosyncratically selected stimuli (ie, higher personal relevance). To do this, the present study used a large sample of chronic pain patients and matched pain-free individuals. Attentional biases were found among both chronic pain patients and pain-free individuals for idiosyncratically selected pictorial stimuli (ie, highest ecological validity and personal relevance) but not for generally selected pictorial stimuli or for pain-related word stimuli, irrespective of whether they were idiosyncratically or generally selected. These biases were found to stem from vigilance for pain-related stimuli. Overall, the findings of the present study suggest that similar pain-related attentional biases can be found among both pain-free individuals and chronic pain patients and that stimulus-related factors may be important to the detection of those biases. Perspective: To date, research examining pain-related attentional biases has yielded inconsistent results. The present study sought to examine 2 stimulus-related factors often identified for their potential to influence the consistency of findings. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering stimulus-related factors when designing and interpreting pain-related dot-probe research. © 2011 by the American Pain Society.","Attentional bias; chronic pain; dot-probe; selective attention; stimulus selection","adult; article; attention; attentional bias; chronic pain; controlled study; ecological validity; female; human; major clinical study; male; pain; rating scale; stimulus response; task performance; validity; Adult; Arousal; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Measurement",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958177254

Attention selection may be guided by low-level stimulus properties, by the emotional value of the stimulus, or more voluntarily by the goals and plans of the observer. Whether these three systems operate independently during attention selection or not remains a debated question. We report results from two studies investigating the extent to which these different attention mechanisms may interact with one another. Using a standard dot probe paradigm wherein effects of exogenous, emotional, and endogenous attention were orthogonally manipulated, we found attentional facilitation effects for each component, indicated by faster decision times for validly, as opposed to invalidly cued targets. Moreover, results confirmed that these three attentional effects added up in a linear fashion. Complementing ERP results allowed us to disentangle the respective contributions of the two reflexive, bottom-up attention processes (exogenous vs. emotional) by showing non-overlapping temporal loci for attentional effects related either to low-level physical properties or the emotional content of the stimulus.

Method: A diverse community sample (55 African American) of men (N = 159) between 21 and 35 years of age (M = 25.80) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 beverage conditions (i.e., alcohol, no-alcohol control) and 1 of 2 distraction conditions (i.e., distraction, no-distraction). Following beverage consumption, participants were provoked via reception of electric shocks and a verbal insult from a fictitious male opponent. Participants' attention allocation to aggression words (i.e., aggression bias) and physical aggression were measured using a dot probe task and a shock-based aggression task, respectively. Results: Intoxicated men whose attention was distracted displayed significantly lower levels of aggression bias and enacted significantly less physical aggression than intoxicated men whose attention was not distracted. However, aggression bias did not account for the lower levels of alcohol-related aggression in the distraction, relative to the no-distraction, condition.

This study examines familial associations among trauma, psychopathology, and attention bias. Specifically, group differences in psychopathology and attention bias were examined in both adults and their children based on trauma exposure. In addition, the association between attention bias in parents and attention bias in their children was examined. Parents exposed to the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks and their children were recruited from the New York City Metropolitan area. Levels of trauma exposure, psychiatric symptoms, and attention bias to threat, as measured with the dot-probe task, were each assessed in 90 subjects, comprising of 45 parents and one of their children. These measures were examined in parents and their children separately; each parent and child was categorized on the presence of high or low levels of trauma exposure. Although trauma exposure did not relate to psychopathology, parents who were highly exposed to trauma showed greater attention bias towards threat than parents with low trauma exposure. However, the children of high trauma-exposed parents did not show enhanced attention bias towards threat, though threat bias in the high trauma-exposed parents did negatively correlate with threat bias in their children. This association between trauma and attention bias in parents was found four-to-five years after 9/11, suggesting that trauma has enduring influences on threat processing. Larger, prospective studies might examine relationships within families among traumatic exposures, psychopathology, and information-processing functions. © 2010.","Attention; Children; Development; Emotion; Faces; Trauma","adolescent; adult; article; child; controlled study; exposure; female; human; life event; major clinical study; male; mental disease; parent; personal experience; priority journal; psychoanalysis; psychotrauma; school child; selective attention; terrorism; threat; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Orientation; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychopathology; September 11 Terrorist Attacks; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","NIH, National Institutes of Health; R01 MH70424, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health","This research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health ( R01 MH70424 ; PI C.

We assessed attentional bias using a visual probe detection task (PDT) that presented pain and social threat words in comparison to neutral words at conscious (1250 ms) and preconscious (20 ms) presentation rates. We administered the PDT before and after random assignment of participants to a laboratory stressor - failure versus success feedback regarding their performance on a challenging computer game. All analyses controlled for trait anxiety. At the conscious rate of stimulus presentation, FAP patients exhibited preferential attention toward pain compared with neutral stimuli and compared with the control group. FAP patients maintained preferential attention toward conscious pain stimuli after performance feedback in both failure and success conditions. At the preconscious rate of stimulus presentation, FAP patients' attention was neutral at baseline but increased significantly toward pain stimuli after performance feedback in both failure and success conditions. FAP patients' somatic symptoms increased in both failure and success conditions; control youth's somatic symptoms only increased after failure. Regarding social threat, neither FAP nor control youth exhibited attentional bias toward social threat compared with neutral stimuli at baseline, but both FAP and control youth in the failure condition significantly increased attention away from social threat after failure feedback. Results suggest that FAP patients preferentially attend to pain stimuli in conscious awareness. Moreover, performance evaluation may activate their preconscious attention to pain stimuli. Patients with functional abdominal pain preferentially attended to pain stimuli in conscious awareness. After performance evaluation, they also attended to pain stimuli in preconscious awareness. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Healthy volunteer models of emotional processing offer a potential means by which novel drugs can be screened prior to clinical trials. Here, we consider the effect of 7 days of treatment with aprepitant in such a model. Method: Healthy volunteers (n∈=∈32) were randomised to receive 7-day treatment with aprepitant (125 mg) or placebo. On the seventh day, participants completed a battery of tasks measuring emotional processing previously demonstrated to be sensitive to conventional antidepressant drugs. The tasks included facial expression recognition, emotional categorisation and memory, attentional dot-probe and emotion potentiated startle task. Results: Aprepitant abolished the emotionally potentiated startle effect and increased recognition memory for emotionally positive versus negative stimuli. In addition, the drug decreased attention to negative relative to positive emotional stimuli on the masked version of the dot-probe task. These effects were seen in the absence of any change in subjective mood. There were no effects on emotional categorisation, recall or on facial expression recognition. Conclusion: These results suggest that NK1 receptor antagonism does affect some aspects of emotional processing and, in particular, that it has anxiolytic-like effects. The profile of effects reported here is, however, more limited than that found in response to conventional antidepressant treatment, and this may explain disappointing results at clinical trial. Healthy volunteer models of emotional processing may be useful in closing the gap between preclinical and clinical trials. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Antidepressant; Anxiolytic; Cognition; Emotion; Human; Substance P","aprepitant; neurokinin 1 receptor; placebo; adult; article; attention; Beck Depression Inventory; Befindlichkeits Scale; controlled study; double blind procedure; emotion; facial expression; female; happiness; human; human experiment; male; memory; normal human; patient compliance; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; priority journal; psychological rating scale; randomized controlled trial; recall; recognition; startle reflex; task performance; tranquilizing activity; unspecified side effect; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Blinking; Double-Blind Method; Electromyography; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Morpholines; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Receptors, Neurokinin-1; Recognition (Psychology); Vocabulary; Young Adult","G0801432, MRC, Medical Research Council; P1vital, Lundbeckfonden; Wyeth; Eli Lilly and Company; GSK, GlaxoSmithKline; GSK, GlaxoSmithKline foundation","The study was funded by the MRC (G0801432)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955592701

This fear is associated with physical and psychological effects that increase the risk of falling. The authors' theory is that attentional processing biases may exist in this population that serve to perpetuate fear of falling and subsequently increase fall risk. As a starting point in testing this proposition, the authors examined selective attentional processing bias to fall-relevant stimuli among older adults. Thirty older adult participants (Mage=70.8±5.8), self-categorized to be Fearful of Falling (FF, n=15) or Non-Fearful of Falling (NF, n=15) completed a visual dot-probe paradigm to determine detection latencies to fall-threatening and general-threat stimuli. Attentional processing was defined using three index scores: attentional bias, congruency index, and incongruency index. Bias indicates capture of attention, whereas congruency and incongruency imply vigilance and disengagement difficulty, respectively. Both groups showed an attentional bias to fall-threat words but those who were fearful of falling also showed an incongruency effect for fall-threat words. These findings confirm that selective attentional processing profiles for fall-relevant stimuli differ between older adults who exhibit fear of falling and those who do not have this fear. Moreover, in accordance with current interpretations of selective attentional processing, the incongruency effect noted among fall-fearful older adults presents a possibility for a difficulty disengaging from fall-threatening stimuli.

In this study, we assessed this association longitudinally in exposed and unexposed individuals. The degree of threat avoidance during exposure was expected to predict levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms 1 year later. Methods: Thirty-two participants were recruited and followed for 12 months, including 18 subjects exposed to rocket attacks and 14 nonexposed subjects. At 1-year follow-up, participants completed self-reports and an attention dot-probe task assessing threat-related bias. Results: State anxiety decreased at follow-up in exposed participants, though posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms remained higher in exposed than in the nonexposed group. Attentional threat avoidance during imminent danger in the exposed group changed to threat attendance a year later, such that both the exposed and the nonexposed group exhibited similar threat bias patterns. As hypothesized, in the exposed group, stronger attentional threat avoidance during stress exposure predicted higher levels of PTSD symptoms 1 year later. Conclusions: Attention bias away from threat during acute stress may relate to risk for PTSD. This suggests that neurocognitive measures may index risk for PTSD.

The present review examined studies that measured the effects of CBT on attentional bias.

Attentional avoidance of negative stimuli and preference for positive stimuli (assessed prior to surgery) have been found to be predictive of postoperative pain. However, findings so far were mainly obtained in young patients with benign diagnoses. The aim of the present study was to test whether this relationship holds for aged patients with poorer prognosis. Design. Preoperatively assessed psychological predictors, including attentional measures for emotionally loaded stimuli, among others, were used to predict acute postoperative pain as indicated by rating and consumption of analgesics. Patients. Fifty-eight patients scheduled for surgery due to cancer (80%) with a mean age of 60.5 years participated in the study. Outcome Measures. As predictors attentional biases for pain-related, social threat, and positive stimuli were assessed in a dot-probe task. Further predictors were self-reported pain vigilance, pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, general anxiety, depression, and somatization, as well as pressure pain thresholds. As criteria of prediction, numerical scale ratings of acute postoperative pain and the amount of analgesics (patient-controlled intravenous analgesia [PCIA]) requested after surgery were used. Results. Only the dot-probe task parameters provided significant explanation of acute postoperative pain. A significant 23% of variance of the PCIA use was accounted for by the dot-probe task parameters. Here, it was mainly the avoidance of social threat words which contributed to significant prediction and did not appear to be related to the other psychological predictors. Seventy-seven percent of the patients with frequent PCIA use could be classified correctly by this variable. Conclusions. Attentional avoidance of emotionally negative stimuli prior to surgery proved to be a powerful predictor of acute postoperative pain reflected by the consumption of analgesics; this time in a sample of aged patients with various but mainly malign diagnoses. This measure outperformed traditional predictors like depression, anxiety, as well as pain catastrophizing, and deserves further attention. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Attention; Postoperative Pain; Psychological Predictor","analgesic agent; adult; anxiety; article; attention; attention disturbance; cancer surgery; colon cancer; depression; drug use; emotion; female; human; kidney cancer; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; ovary cancer; pain assessment; pain threshold; pancreas cancer; postoperative pain; prediction; preoperative evaluation; prognosis; prostate cancer; rating scale; retroperitoneum; self report; small intestine cancer; somatization; stomach cancer; urinary tract cancer; Aged; Analgesics; Anxiety; Attention; Avoidance Learning; Catastrophization; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold; Pain, Postoperative; Predictive Value of Tests; Social Behavior",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954617048

Methods: Adopting event-related potential (ERP) technique, the ERP at 64 electrode spots in 10 heroin addicts (test group) were recorded before and after EA intervention with dot-probe experimental form during implementing cognitive task on positive emotional clue (PEC), negative emotional clues (NEC), and heroin-related clue (HRC). The P200 amplitude components on the selected observation points (Fz, Cz, and Pz) were analyzed and compared with those obtained from 10 healthy subjects as the control. Results: Before EA, the ERP of attention on HRC in the test group was higher than that on PEC and NEC (P<0.05) and significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05); after EA, the P200 amplitude of attention on HRC at Cz and Pz was significantly lowered (P<0.05) and that on PEC at Fz was significantly elevated (P<0.05). After EA, the P200 amplitude at Pz was ranked as NEC > PEC > HRC, but in the control group, it showed PEC > HRC at all three observation points and PEC > NEC at Pz. Conclusion: Heroin addicts show attention bias to HRC, which could be significantly reduced by EA intervention, illustrating that EA could effectively inhibit the attention bias to heroin and so might have potential for lowering the relapse rate. © The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Attention bias; Electro-acupuncture; Event-related potential; Heroin abstinence","article; brain function; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; drug withdrawal; electroacupuncture; event related potential; heroin dependence; human; priority journal; therapy effect; Adult; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Electroacupuncture; Evoked Potentials; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Male; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome","200062; 830000; 86-15099629599; 201108; 10.1007/s11655-011-0698-y, DOI, U.S. Department of the Interior; 201203; 07ZZ48; 30271637","©The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011 Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30271637) and Research Items of the Education Committee of Shanghai (No. 07ZZ48) 1.

The WHO advises the use of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. However, at present no experimental studies are available investigating if pictorial warnings modulate incentive properties of cigarette packages. Fifty-nine tobacco smokers and 55 non-smokers performed a visual dot probe task to assess attention allocation towards cigarette packages with and without health warnings. Smokers were divided a priori in a group of light smokers (< 20 cigarettes/day; n = 39) and heavy smokers (≥ 20 cigarettes/day; n = 20). Psychometric measures on anxiety and nicotine craving were administered. Light smokers showed an attentional bias towards packages without pictorial warnings while no effects were observed in the other groups. In heavy smokers attention allocation towards pictorial health warnings was associated with an increase of craving and anxiety. The results have a potential public health perspective as pictorial health warnings might be an effective strategy to reduce attentional bias towards cigarette packages of light smokers, while counterproductive effects in heavy smokers warrant further investigation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, eye movement (EM) tracking assessed biases in specific component processes of visual attention (i.e., orientation, detection, maintenance and disengagement of gaze) in relation to body-related stimuli among 20 weight dissatisfied (WD) and 20 weight satisfied young women. Eye movements were recorded while participants completed a dot-probe task that featured fatness-neutral and thinness-neutral word pairs. Compared to controls, WD women were more likely to direct their initial gaze toward fatness words, had a shorter mean latency of first fixation on both fatness and thinness words, had longer first fixation on fatness words but shorter first fixation on thinness words, and shorter total gaze duration on thinness words. Reaction time data showed a maintenance bias towards fatness words among the WD women. In sum, results indicated WD women show initial orienting, speeded detection and initial maintenance biases towards fat body words in addition to a speeded detection - avoidance pattern of biases in relation to thin body words. In sum, results highlight the importance of the utility of EM-tracking as a means of identifying subtle attentional biases among weight dissatisfied women drawn from a non-clinical setting and the need to assess attentional biases as a dynamic process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Attentional bias; Avoidance; Eye movements; Initial orienting; Maintenance; Weight dissatisfaction","adult; article; attention; avoidance behavior; body image; body weight; controlled study; eye fixation; eye movement; female; gaze; human; human experiment; latent period; orientation; reaction time; satisfaction; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Body Image; Body Weight; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Orientation; Personal Satisfaction; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Self Concept; Visual Perception","SWU1009086; JCU, James Cook University; SWU110041; NCET-2008-0870, NCET, Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; 30870774, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","This research was supported by Chinese National Natural Science Foundation ( 30870774 ) and New Century Excellent Talents in University ( NCET-2008-0870 ) from the State Education Commission to Hong Chen, Central Universities Fundamental Research Funds ( SWU1009086 ) and Southwest University Doctoral Funds ( SWU110041 ) grants to Xiao Gao and a research fellowship from the Cairns Institute, James Cook University to Todd Jackson.

For instance, it has been suggested that correlation between slow (1-3. Hz) and fast (13-30.

Indirect support comes from several studies reporting relationships between coherence and subjectively reported behavioral inhibition and state anxiety. The present study sought to extend this work and tested the prediction that objectively, experimentally, measured threat-selective attention should also be related to coherence. EEG frequency band power and dot probe task performance were assessed in forty healthy women and results demonstrated a negative association between delta-beta coherence and automatic, anxiety-driven attentional avoidance of threatening pictorial stimuli. These first reported objective measures for cognitive-emotional behavior obtained in relation to delta-beta coherence provide additional support for the hypothesis that this EEG parameter may reflect emotion regulation processes and supports suggestions that coherence may be a useful tool in the experimental study of affect and psychopathology.

Here we investigated whether temporary changes in food preference influence visual selective attention. To this end, we exploited the fact that when a food is eaten to satiety its motivational value and perceived pleasantness decrease relative to other foods not eaten in the meal, an effect termed sensory-specific satiety. A total of 26 hungry participants were fed until sated with one of two palatable foods. Before and after selective satiation, participants rated the pleasantness of the two foods and then viewed the same as stimuli on a computer screen while attention was assessed by a visual probe task. Results showed that the attentional bias for the food eaten decreased markedly from pre- to postsatiety, along with the subjective pleasantness for that food. By contrast, subjective pleasantness and attentional bias for the food not eaten did not show any such decrease. These findings suggest that the allocation of visual selective attention is flexibly and rapidly adjusted to reflect temporary shift in relative preference for different foods. © 2010 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Food; Pleasantness; Reward value; Sensory-specific satiety; Visual selective attention","adult; analysis of variance; article; attention; decision making; epidemiology; female; food preference; human; instrumental conditioning; male; methodology; photostimulation; physiology; pleasure; psychophysiology; radiation exposure; reaction time; regression analysis; time; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Choice Behavior; Conditioning, Operant; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Pleasure; Reaction Time; Regression Analysis; Satiety Response; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951978147

Following training, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor (i.e., videotaped speech), and state anxiety and positive affect in response to the stressor were assessed. Results revealed that individual variability in the capacity to develop an attentional bias for positive information following training predicted subsequent emotional responses to the stressor.

These variables can be assessed by explicit measures based on conscious self-report, or by implicit measures assessing mainly preconscious stages of information processing such as behavioural or electrophysiological tests. Convergent validity within implicit measures was assumed to be high, as was the discriminant validity between implicit and explicit measures. METHOD: In the present study, two implicit measures (the dot-probe task for pain words and a word-processing task for pain words allowing event-related brain potential recordings) and three self-report measures (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and Pain Hypervigilance and Awareness Questionnaire) were administered to 27 healthy participants. RESULTS: No significant associations were found between the implicit measures, or between the event-related brain potentials of pain words and the explicit measures. A single significant positive correlation was found between the dot-probe pain bias and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale. CONCLUSION: All variables appeared to be only weakly associated. The attempt to organize the field of variables targeting attentional and emotional mechanisms of processing pain-related information using concepts such as implicit and explicit measures failed as far as the present test on convergent/discriminant validity proved. ©2011 Pulsus Group Inc.

These biases, or cognitive errors, systematically distort the individual's experiences and, in that way, maintains the eating disorder. This chapter presents an updated literature review of experimental studies investigating these cognitive biases. Results indicate that ED patients show biases in attention, interpretation, and memory when it comes to the processing of food-, weight-, and body shape-related cues. Some recent studies show that they also demonstrate errors in general cognitive abilities such as set shifting, central coherence, and decision making. A future challenge is whether cognitive biases and processes can be manipulated. Few preliminary studies suggest that an attention retraining and training in the cognitive modulation of food reward processing might be effective strategies to change body satisfaction, food cravings, and eating behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","Attention; Body image; Central coherence; Cognitive bias; Craving; Decision-making; Food reward; Interpretation; Memory; Retraining; Set shifting","article; attention bias; cognition; cognitive bias; cognitive therapy; decision making; disease association; dot probe task; eating disorder; emotion; explicit memory bias; eye tracking; human; implicit memory bias; interpretation bias; investigative procedures; memory bias; mental performance; priority journal; reward; sense of coherence; set shifting; Stroop test; systematic error; task performance; therapy effect; visual search task; cognitive defect; eating disorder; neuropsychological test; psychological aspect; review; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Therapy; Eating Disorders; Emotions; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-82855178498

Attentional bias was assessed using a visual probe task which presented pain-related (sensory and affective), social threat, anger-related, and neutral words at two exposure duration conditions: 500 ms and 1250 ms. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with CDH showed significantly greater attentional bias towards pain-related words at 1250 ms, indicating a bias in maintained attention to pain cues in this group. No significant differences between groups were found in attentional bias scores at the shorter stimulus duration of 500 ms. No significant differences between groups were found in attentional bias scores to social threat and anger-related words at either stimulus presentation duration. When compared to 0, in all group and duration combinations there was significant positive bias towards anger. Across the whole sample, pain bias scores at 1250 ms were significantly associated with anger out, whilst anger bias scores at both 500 ms and 1250 ms correlated significantly with trait anger. The results of the present investigation support the content-specificity hypothesis, according to which attentional bias in patients with chronic pain is shown only towards pain-related cues.

Although recent randomized control trials (RCTs) suggest that ABMT reduces anxiety, therapeutic effects have not been summarized quantitatively. Methods Standard meta-analytic procedures were used to summarize the effect of ABMT on anxiety. With MEDLINE, January 1995 to February 2010, we identified RCTs comparing the effects on anxiety of ABMT and quantified effect sizes with Hedge's d. Results Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, including 467 participants from 10 publications. Attention Bias Modification Treatment produced significantly greater reductions in anxiety than control training, with a medium effect (d = .61, p < .001). Age and gender did not moderate the effect of ABMT on anxiety, whereas several characteristics of the ABMT training did. Conclusions Attention Bias Modification Treatment shows promise as a novel treatment for anxiety. Additional RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the degree to which these findings replicate and apply to patients.

However, the extent to which this ability is present in young children and whether or not this ability is genetically mediated is untested. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to assess the spatial-attentional properties of emotional faces in young children, with a preliminary test of whether this effect was influenced by genetics. Five-year-old twin pairs performed a dot-probe task. The results suggest that children preferentially direct spatial attention to emotional faces, particularly right visual field faces.

In this study we examined the effects of evolutionarily relevant (e.g. spiders and snakes) and irrelevant (e.g. knifes and syringes) threatening cues. Non-predictive threatening cues (in left or right visual field) were paired with non-threatening cues and were followed by neutral targets in the same or opposite location. The amplitude of the target P1 was increased in contralateral electrodes when the target followed in the same location as the threatening cues.

In order to detect a possible motivational ambivalence, self-report and psychophysiological measures of the sympathetic and parasympathetic response system were assessed additionally.

The current study evaluated the efficacy of an attentional training intervention for reducing attentional bias toward smoking cues and craving among cigarette smokers. Methods: Participants were randomized to receive an attentional training intervention or a control training. Sixty-four regular cigarette smokers (individuals smoking at least 10 cigarettes/day for at least 1 year) provided informed consent and were enrolled in the study. The dot probe paradigm was used both to measure attentional bias and for the training intervention. Attentional bias and craving were measured prior to and following training. Results: Results indicated that the randomized groups did not differ significantly in attentional bias as measured by novel stimuli and, correspondingly, in craving response to relevant cues following the training intervention. Conclusions: These results for a single-session training suggest that this ""dose"" is insufficient for reducing attentional bias. Given the success of this intervention in other applications, research on the efficacy of multiple-session trainings is an important area for further study. © The Author 2010.

Repressors reported greater pain during recovery than low- and high-anxious participants, but they reported lower distress than high-anxious participants. Repressors reported significant and large discrepancies between high pain and low distress, whereas these differences were less pronounced for other groups. In Study 2, 77 participants underwent an ischemic pain task while performing a modified dot-probe task with sensory and negative affective pain words as stimuli. Repressors showed increasing biases away from affective pain words and toward sensory pain words as the pain task continued, whereas low- and high-anxious participants did not show these shifts in attention. The results support the notion that conversion among repressors may involve a process by which attention is directed away from emotional distress during noxious stimulation and is focused instead on sensory information from pain. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Acute pain; Attention bias; Repressive coping","adult; article; attention; conversion disorder; coping behavior; defense mechanism; emotional stress; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; pain; Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Pain; Semantics; Stress, Psychological; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650711376

Four probes were synthesized by chemical coupling and protein denaturation with CdSe/ZnS, CdTe QDs, and transferrin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis were used to verify the conjugation of these luminescent probes. The cytotoxicity of these four luminescent probes and the original QDs were evaluated in HeLa cells. The results showed that over 92% of HeLa cells were still alive after being exposed to 3.2-μM CdSe/ZnS QDs capped with denatured transferrin for 72 h. Furthermore, while the probe preparation was very simple, the photoluminescence quantum yield of this probe was 7% higher than the original CdSe/ZnS QDs.

Their relevance was determined in comparison with other psychological and physiological predictors (depression, anxiety, somatization, cortisol reactivity, pain sensitivity). In 84 young male patients the predictor variables were assessed one day before surgery (correction of chest malformation). Postoperative outcome (subjective pain intensity and pain-related disability) was assessed three (N = 84) and six months (N = 78) after surgery. Patients were classified into good and poor outcome groups. Patients with high pain intensity three (25%) or six months (14%) after surgery, differed significantly from those low in pain with regard to their preoperative performance in the dot-probe task (high attentional bias towards positive words). A sizeable portion (54%) of patients still felt disabled due to pain after three months and a few patients after six months (13%). These patients were those with high preoperative ratings in the Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire. The few subjectively disabled patients after six months could be identified in addition by low pressure pain and high cold pain thresholds before surgery. An attentional bias towards positive stimuli prior to surgery may indicate a maladaptive coping style, which avoids necessary confrontation with pain and predisposes patients to chronic postoperative pain.

Four groups were recruited: 1) acute LBP patients; 2) chronic LBP patients from physiotherapy practices; 3) chronic LBP patients from a tertiary referral pain-management center; and 4) healthy pain-free controls. Participants were assessed on the dot-probe computer task for attentional bias to pain-related words.

These results suggest that the experience of pain, rather than duration, is the primary indicator of the presence of pain-related biases.

Biases towards sensory-pain stimuli were demonstrated regardless of pain duration; however, they were present in those with low and moderate levels of fear of (re)injury only and not those high in fear.

Using a dot-probe task to reveal the spatial allocation of attention, we investigate whether other-race infants capture attention.

However, studies of euthymic bipolar disorder patients may be confounded by the experience of mood episodes and medication. We therefore assessed an adolescent group for vulnerability markers associated with the bipolar phenotype. Methods: The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is a screening tool for bipolar disorder that targets mood-elevation symptoms. We selected 32 high-scoring students (≥ 7 symptoms) with the adolescent bipolar phenotype and 30 low-scoring controls (≤ 3 symptoms) and screened them with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus for bipolar disorder and other psychiatric disorders. We investigated emotional processing by assessing facial expression recognition, emotional memory, emotion-potentiated startle, and a dot-probe task. Results: Of the high-MDQ participants, 12 were in remission from bipolar disorder defined by DSM-IV-TR and interview (bipolar II disorder/bipolar disorder not otherwise specified) and 3 from major depressive disorder. High-MDQ participants had higher levels of neuroticism, low mood, and lifetime anxiety comorbidity and alcohol dependence compared with low-MDQ participants. The high-MDQ group showed facilitated recognition of surprised and neutral facial expressions and enhanced processing of positive versus negative information in emotional recognition memory and emotion-potentiated startle. There were no effects on emotional categorisation/recall memory or attentional bias in the dot-probe task. Conclusions: These results suggest that students with the common adolescent bipolar phenotype show positive emotional processing biases despite increased levels of neuroticism, low mood, and anxiety.

Results showed an attention bias towards threat among anxious participants, but not among nonanxious participants. No bias to positive faces was found. ERP data revealed enhanced C1 amplitude (∼80. ms following threat onset) in anxious relative to nonanxious participants when cue displays contained threat faces. Additionally, P2 amplitude to the faces display was higher in the anxious relative to the nonanxious group regardless of emotion condition (angry/happy/neutral). None of the ERP analyses associated with target processing were significant. In conclusion, our data suggest that a core feature of threat processing in anxiety lies in functional perturbations of a brain circuitry that reacts rapidly and vigorously to threat.

Among individuals with emotional or motivational disorders, such as anxiety disorders and addiction, this 'attentional bias' seems to be a permanent feature. But does attentional bias just represent an output of the underlying state, or could it also bring about changes in states or even longer-term changes in 'traits'? The latter possibility has been the driving force behind recent research suggesting that attentional bias modification could have a role to play as a treatment for psychopathologies such as anxiety disorders and addiction.",,,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955941636

This probe consists of three identical copper toroids placed around a high-voltage electrode, where all are coaxially assembled in a large earthed cylinder. The probe was first simulated by a finite-element package to optimize the assembly and reduce the electric field inside it. This was confirmed by an alternating current test to ensure a corona-free design. Simultaneous impulse voltage measurements were done using the designed D-dot probe-two commercial mixed resistivecapacitive (RC) probes and a damped capacitive voltage divider. The linearity of the D-dot probe was checked under unloaded and loaded conditions. Results reveal that the larger the toroid separation and/or the lower the attenuator capacitance is, the higher the measured voltage from the middle ""signal"" toroid will be. The residual voltage waveforms for an 11-kV SA, measured by two commercial mixed RC probes and the damped capacitive voltage divider, showed an initial inductive overshoot superimposed on the waveform and a significant decay, even before the current peak instant. On the contrary, the voltage measured by the designed D -dot probe gave a voltage waveform that looked like that of the current and slightly led the latter. For the damped capacitive voltage divider and the two commercial mixed RC probes, neither the peak voltage nor the voltage at peak current gave the correct currentvoltage characteristics. This confirms the contradiction of some published SA models in the high-conduction regime because most models were based on measurements done by different and large-impulse capacitive or resistive voltage dividers with improper compensation. © 2006 IEEE.","D-dot probes; electric field sensors; fast-front voltages; impulse voltage measurement; surge arresters (SAs); voltage dividers","Electric field sensors; Impulse voltage; impulse voltage measurement; Surge arresters; surge arresters (SAs); Electric field measurement; Electric fields; Electric surges; Probes; Sensors; Voltage dividers; Voltage measurement; Current voltage characteristics","SQU, Sultan Qaboos University","Manuscript received December 30, 2008; revised July 27, 2009; accepted August 4, 2009.

Questions concerning the mechanisms driving these effects remain unanswered, particularly considering theorized attentional adaptations that may be elicited by acute exercise bouts. We investigated pre- and post-exercise attentional bias to examine possible attentional explanations that may account for these reported changes in affect. On separate visits to the laboratory, 30 high trait anxious participants completed 30 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 70% of their heart rate reserve, or completed a 30-min quiet rest protocol. During each intervention, pre-test and post-test modified dot-probe assessments of attentional bias were completed, as were a series of self-report anxiety and affect questionnaires. Attentional bias scores and reaction times were calculated. Post-exercise dot probe performance did not vary significantly as a function of the affective valence of presented stimuli. As hypothesized, however, positive affect and reaction time improved significantly following exercise compared with the pre- and post-rest conditions and the pre-exercise condition, suggesting that exercise facilitates a broadening of attentional scope. Implications of these findings and future directions are discussed within the context of traditional and contemporary theories of dispositional affect and state-specific emotional responses. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Aerobic; Anxiety; Attentional bias; Emotion","adolescent; adult; affect; anxiety; article; attention; exercise; exercise test; female; heart rate; human; male; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological aspect; questionnaire; rest; Adolescent; Affect; Anxiety; Attention; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Rest; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955744811

The current study examines whether the 5- HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with attentional biases for negative word stimuli. Methods: Unmedicated, young adults with low current depression and anxiety symptoms (N5106) were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs25531 in the long allele of the 5-HTTLPR. Participants then completed a standard dot-probe task that measured attentional bias toward anxiety, dysphoric, and self-esteem words. Results: The LALA allele group demonstrated an attentional bias away from negative word stimuli. This attentional bias was absent among the S/LG carriers.

Dietary restraint scores were correlated with self-reported appetitive response to food, sensitivity to reward, and sensitivity to punishment. Results provide limited support for the hypothesis that individuals with elevated dietary restraint scores show greater reward sensitivity and cognitive bias for food stimuli, though it is possible that the null findings on the behavioral task resulted because of an approach-avoidance conflict to food cues in which heightened appetitive responses to food are inhibited by food-related anxiety. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Attentional bias; Dietary restraint; Eating behaviour; Food reward; Indirect measures; Taste preferences; Weight control","adolescent; adult; appetite; article; behavior; body mass; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet restriction; ethics; fast food; feeding behavior; female; health survey; human; informed consent; instrumental conditioning; major clinical study; measurement; outcome assessment; questionnaire; research subject; reward; selective attention; sensitivity analysis; stimulus response; taste; visual analog scale; visual stimulation; association; diet; food; habituation; impulsiveness; physiology; psychology; punishment; Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Cues; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Punishment; Questionnaires; Reward; Taste; Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Cues; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Punishment; Questionnaires; Reward; Taste",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953962757

In alcohol dependence, attentional bias has been associated with severity of alcoholism, craving, treatment outcome, and relapse. Forty-three patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to an ABM intervention or control training. The procedure consisted of five sessions in which patients were trained to disengage attention from alcohol-related stimuli (ABM condition) or in which they were trained on an irrelevant reaction-time test (control condition). We measured the effects of ABM on the visual-probe task, with stimuli that were presented in the ABM and with new stimuli. Craving was measured with the Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire. Follow-up data were gathered for overall treatment success, and relapse up to 3 months after the intervention. ABM was effective in increasing the ability to disengage from alcohol-related cues. This effect generalized to untrained, new stimuli. There were no significant effects on subjective craving. For other outcome measures there were indications of clinically relevant effects. Results indicate that ABM among alcohol-dependent patients was effective and that it may affect treatment progression.

Furthermore, administration of an alcohol preload increases attentional bias for alcohol and tobacco-related cues in heavy drinkers and tobacco smokers, respectively. The present study investigated attentional bias for cocaine cues in cocaine users and nonusers following administration of either alcohol or placebo. Method Thirty-two regular cocaine users and 40 non-users took part. Participants were administered alcohol or placebo, and administration was double blind. After drink administration, a Visual Probe task and Modified Stroop task were used to assess attentional bias. Subjective craving and alcohol outcome expectancies were also measured. Results There was a significant interaction between group and drink type on the visual probe task indicating that cocaine users who had received alcohol had increased attentional bias for cocaine pictures compared to non-users and cocaine users who received placebo. The cocaine Stroop revealed no differences between cocaine users and non-users, and no effects of alcohol in either group. Conclusions Alcohol preload in regular cocaine users increases attentional bias for cocaine cues. However, cocaine users who received placebo did not show attentional bias for cocaine stimuli.

The relevancy of this information is highlighted by findings that backward masked facial expressions facilitate spatial attention. This attention effect appears to be mediated through a neural network consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and visual cortex. However, a direct investigation of the neural time course associated with orienting to such stimuli has yet to be performed. In the current investigation, a backward masked fearful face dot-probe task was performed while ERPs were recorded. Reaction time results suggest that spatial attention is captured by backward masked fearful faces and attention is focused at the location of the fear stimulus. Masked right visual field fearful faces enhanced the N170 amplitudes of contralateral occipito-temporal electrodes. The rapid contralateral N170 enhancement was positively correlated with participants' behavioral index of spatial attention. Thus, backward masked fearful face-elicited spatial attention facilitates behavior and modulates the early stage of facial processing reflected by the N170. © 2010.","Backward masking; Emotion; Facial expressions; Fear; Spatial attention","adult; amplitude modulation; article; attention; behavior; controlled study; event related potential; evoked visual response; facial expression; fear; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; response time; stimulus response; visual field; visual masking; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Occipital Lobe; Orientation; Perceptual Masking; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Space Perception; Temporal Lobe; Visual Fields; Visual Pathways",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952544327

Although acute stress is known to increase craving, it is not known whether this effect is mediated via changes in attentional bias and inhibitory control. Objectives: To examine the effect of a mild stressor on inhibitory control, attentional bias and craving in current opiate users (methadone maintained), ex-users (currently abstinent) and non-users (healthy controls). Method: Forty-eight participants (16 in each group) were exposed to both stress and non-stress conditions, after which inhibitory control and attentional bias was assessed using a Go-No-go and dot probe task respectively. Subjective ratings of stress levels and drug craving were repeatedly monitored. Results: Current opiate users had significantly higher cravings ratings than both other groups at all times, and their craving tended to increase following the stress task. Current users had a greater attentional bias towards drug-related stimuli than the ex-users. Interestingly, ex-users showed a bias away from drug-related stimuli in the stress condition and this correlated positively with their length of abstinence. On the Go/No-go task, all groups had fewer false alarms in the stress condition.

Methods AB was examined in a group of adult drinkers (n = 25). Two measures of attentional bias were obtained from a modified visual probe task. First, a traditional dot probe detection task measured attentional bias in drinkers based on their reaction times to probes replacing neutral and alcohol-related images. Secondly, an eye-tracking measure was applied to this task to directly assess the drinkers' eye gazes to the alcohol-related and neutral images. The effect of image complexity was examined by comparing AB towards images classified as simple and complex. Findings Results showed that drinkers displayed AB only towards simple alcohol-related images as measured by both probe RT and fixation times.

Results: Contrary to the hypotheses, participants in the body dissatisfaction condition did not demonstrate an increase in attention toward negative shape/weight words compared with the negative mood and neutral conditions. Indeed, it was the negative mood induction that resulted in significantly increased attention toward negative shape/weight words relative to the body dissatisfaction condition.

The aim of this study was to examine which cognitive functions of attention processing are modulated by attention training, and how a priori anxiety interacts with the attention training procedure. Specifically, we expected modulation in the P1/N1 event-related potential (ERP) complex if early spatial attention was to be affected by training and modulation in later ERP components (P2, N2, P3) had training affected top-down attentional processes.Method Thirty anxious and 30 non-anxious adults performed a modified probe detection task. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded throughout for later ERP analyses. Half the participants in each anxiety group were randomly assigned to undergo a training procedure designed to divert their attention away from threat and the other half received placebo training.Results Anxious participants who were trained to avoid threat showed a linear reduction in response time (RT) to targets replacing neutral faces with the progression of training. This change in RT was not observed among non-anxious participants or among anxious participants who were exposed to placebo training. Following training, the anxious participants who were trained to avoid threat showed a reduction in P2 and P3 mean amplitudes and an enhancement in N2 mean amplitude.Conclusions Attention training affects anxious participants whereas non-anxious participants seem not to respond to it.

These results suggest that while antagonism of NK1 receptors does affect emotional processing in humans, its effects are more restricted and less consistent across tasks than those of conventional antidepressants. Human models of emotional processing may provide a useful means of assessing the likely therapeutic potential of new treatments for depression. © 2010 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","Animal models; Depression; Emotional processing; Substance p","aprepitant; neurokinin 1 receptor; placebo; antidepressant agent; aprepitant; morpholine derivative; adult; article; attention; drug absorption; drug antagonism; drug effect; emotionality; facial expression; female; human; human experiment; male; memory; normal human; priority journal; recognition; single drug dose; adolescent; affect; brain; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; emotion; metabolism; middle aged; oral drug administration; perception; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Antidepressive Agents; Attention; Brain; Cognition; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Morpholines; Perceptual Masking; Reaction Time; Receptors, Neurokinin-1; Recognition (Psychology); Young Adult","G0701421, MRC, Medical Research Council; G9900922, MRC, Medical Research Council",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950445053

Twenty-six overweight/obese (BMI: 30.00 ± 4.62) and 40 normal-weight (BMI: 20.63 ± 1.14) females were randomly assigned to a condition of hunger or satiety. Three indexes of attention were employed, all including pictures of food items: an eye-tracking paradigm (gaze direction and duration), a visual probe task (reaction times), and a recording of electrophysiological brain activity (amplitude of the P300 event-related potential). In addition, the acute food intake of participants was assessed using a bogus taste task. In general, an attentional bias towards food pictures was found in all participants. No differences between groups or conditions were observed in the eye-tracking data. The visual probe task revealed an enhanced automatic orientation towards food cues in hungry versus satiated, and in overweight/obese versus normal-weight individuals, but no differences between groups or conditions in maintained attention. The P300 amplitude showed that only in normal-weight participants the intentional allocation of attention to food pictures was enhanced in hunger versus satiety. In hungry overweight/obese participants, the P300 bias for food pictures was not clearly present, although an increased food intake was observed especially in this group. In conclusion, various attention-related tasks yielded various results, suggesting that they measure different underlying processes. Strikingly, overweight/obese individuals appear to automatically direct their attention to food-related stimuli, to a greater extent than normal-weight individuals, particularly when food-deprived. Speculatively, hungry overweight/obese individuals also appear to use cognitive strategies to reduce a maintained attentional bias for food stimuli, perhaps in an attempt to prevent disinhibited food intake. However, in order to draw firm conclusions, replication studies are needed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants without excessive worry completed a modified dot-probe task, designed to train attention either to threat or neutral words. Half of each group was given explicit instructions regarding the relationship between word valence and target location, and half were given the more usual minimal instructions. Impact on worry persistence was assessed by categorizing the valence of thought intrusions before and after a period of instructed worry. Response latencies to test items on the dot-probe task showed that attention had been successfully manipulated in the expected direction, and explicit instructions led to more effective attention modification. Moreover, participants in the attend-threat group who received explicit instructions reported significantly more negative thought intrusions following instructed worry, as rated by an assessor, whereas participants in the attend-neutral group did not. These findings suggest that an attentional bias towards threatening information plays a role in worry persistence, and that explicit instructions may be helpful in modifying this bias. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The short allele of 5-HTTLPR may act via its effect on neurotransmitter availability, while attention biases shape broad patterns of cognitive processing. We examined individual differences in attention bias to emotion faces as a function of 5-HTTLPR genotype. Adolescents (N = 117) were classified for presumed SLC6A4 expression based on 5-HTTLPR-low (SS, SLG, or LGLG), intermediate (SLA or LALG), or high (LALA). Participants completed the dot-probe task, measuring attention biases toward or away from angry and happy faces. Biases for angry faces increased with the genotype-predicted neurotransmission levels (low &gt; intermediate &gt; high). The reverse pattern was evident for happy faces.

Methods: Ninety-one children with an anxiety disorder were included in the present study. Children received a standardized stepped-care CBT. Three treatment response groups were distinguished: initial responders (anxiety disorder free after phase one: child-focused CBT), secondary responders (anxiety disorder free after phase two: child-parent-focused CBT), and treatment non-responders. Treatment response was determined using a semi-structured clinical interview. Children performed a pictorial dot-probe task before and after stepped-care CBT (i.e., before phase one and after phase two CBT). Results: Changes in selective attention to severely threatening pictures, but not to mildly threatening pictures, were significantly associated with treatment success. At pre-treatment assessment, initial responders selectively attended away from severely threatening pictures, whereas secondary responders selectively attended toward severely threatening pictures. After stepped-care CBT, initial and secondary responders did not show any selectivity in the attentional processing of severely threatening pictures. Treatment non-responders did not show any changes in selective attention due to CBT. Conclusions: Initial and secondary treatment responders showed a reduction of their predisposition to selectively attend away or toward severely threatening pictures, respectively. Treatment non-responders did not show any changes in selective attention. The pictorial dot-probe task can be considered a potentially valuable tool in assigning children to appropriate treatment formats as well as for monitoring changes in selective attention during the course of CBT. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Childhood anxiety disorders; Cognitive-behavioural therapy; Dot-probe task; Selective attention","Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Child; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-73549110899

First, hypervigilance to pain within FGID may exacerbate pain perception and pain-related distress. Second, hypervigilance to socially threatening stimuli could account for the disrupted social functioning reported by patients. Furthermore, stress-related variations in reported symptom severity and functioning impairments may reflect changes in cognitive bias with psychological state. Patterns of selective attention were probed within a sample of putative FGID participants (pFGID). The effect of rumination induction on performance on a modified exogenous cueing task was examined. Thirty-three women with pFGID and 27 matched controls responded to dot probes following pain, social threat and neutral word cues, both before and after rumination (passive self-focused thought), or distraction induction. Reaction times revealed that after rumination but not neutral distraction, pFGID participants showed enhanced attention to social threat words, but not to pain or neutral words. Between-group differences in mood, anxiety or depression could not account for these effects.

The purpose of this study was to assess initial orienting to negative and positive emotional faces in female adolescents with BPD. Method: Adolescent patients with BPD (n = 30), adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 29) and adolescent healthy comparison subjects (n = 29) were tested with the visual dot probe task to examine attentional orienting to emotional and neutral faces. Results: In contrast to the adolescent healthy comparison subjects, both the adolescent patients with BPD and the adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses showed a stronger orienting to negative emotional stimuli. However, no differences were found between the clinical groups. Data regarding positive stimuli showed that BPD is not associated with a specific orienting to positive faces. Conclusions: These findings suggest that attentional orienting to negative faces is not specific to adolescent patients with BPD but also affects adolescent patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, no distortion in information processing concerning positive cues was observed in adolescent patients with BPD.

The study extended previous research on the effect of mood on food motivation by using (i) an experimental mood manipulation, (ii) an established index of attentional bias from the visual-probe task and (iii) pictorial food cues, which have greater ecological validity than word stimuli. Young female adults (n = 80) were randomly allocated to a neutral or negative mood induction procedure. Attentional biases were assessed at two cue exposure durations (500 and 2000 ms). Results showed that negative mood increased both attentional bias for food cues and subjective appetite. Attentional bias and subjective appetite were positively inter-correlated, suggesting a common mechanism, i.e. activation of the food-reward system. Attentional bias was also associated with trait eating style, such as external and restrained eating. Thus, current mood and trait eating style each influenced motivation for food (as reflected by subjective appetite and attentional bias).

In the present study, we used polysomnography (PSG) to fill this void. Design: Patients with primary insomnia and healthy controls were studied using a visual dot probe task (VDP) and an emotional Stroop task (EST). Additionally, polysomnography was carried out in a sub-sample (n = 22) of patients in the subsequent night. Setting: Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Freiburg Medical Center. Participants: Thirty patients with primary insomnia and 30 matched healthy controls. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Patients with primary insomnia demonstrated a significant sleep-related attentional bias compared to controls in the EST but no significant group effects were found for the VDP. VDP attentional bias scores were positively correlated with measures of sleep pressure, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and the amount of slow wave sleep. EST attentional bias scores were not correlated with subsequent PSG parameters, and we did not observe a correlation between attentional bias scores on the two tasks. Conclusions: The unexpected relationship between increased attentional bias, in the VDP task, and improved markers of sleep duration and continuity, may be indicative of a homeostatic craving for sleep in those with high attentional bias. This awaits further testing in multiple night studies, to shed light on the mechanisms and implications of sleep-related attentional bias.","Attentional bias; Emotional stroop task; Polysomnography; Primary insomnia; Visual dot probe task","adult; aged; article; attention; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; female; human; insomnia; male; polysomnography; priority journal; psychiatry; psychotherapy; sleep; sleep pattern; sleep time; slow wave sleep; task performance; withdrawal syndrome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149116356

Method: We investigated whether body dissatisfaction is associated with an attentional bias toward thin bodies using a modified dot probe task. Results: In three studies, we found that undergraduate females were faster to discriminate the direction of an arrow cue when it appeared in the location previously occupied by a thin than a fat body. This attentional bias toward thin bodies was found using extreme stimuli (thin and fat bodies) presented for 500 ms (Experiment 1), extreme stimuli presented for 150 ms (Experiment 2), and less extreme stimuli that were equated for perceived extremity, presented for 150 ms (Experiment 3). When the stimuli were equated on perceptual extremity, the more dissatisfied a woman was with her body, and the larger her own BMI, the less of an attentional bias she showed toward thin bodies. Discussion: Our results indicate that women have an attentional bias to thin bodies, which appears to be automatic. Contrary to prediction, this bias was weaker in women with greater BMI and body dissatisfaction. This result offers no support for the view that selective attention to thin bodies is causally related to body dissatisfaction. © 2009 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Attentional bias; Body dissatisfaction; Dot probe; Social comparison; Sociocultural attitudes","adolescent; adult; article; body build; body mass; body size; body weight; fat body; feeding behavior; female; human; human experiment; limb; prediction; priority journal; selective attention; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Body Image; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Cues; Female; Health Status; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Self Concept; Social Perception; Time Factors; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-74049128812

However, little is known to date about the potential risk factors for these forms of maladaptive processing. The aim of the present study was to shed more light on this issue. A very comprehensive set of predictor variables was examined in healthy pain-free subjects. METHOD: Participants were 92 young and healthy subjects (mean [± SD] age 26.99±6.90 years; 47 men, 45 women). Maladaptive attentional and emotional mechanisms of pain processing were assessed by self-report measures of pain hypervigilance, pain-related anxiety and pain catastrophizing, as well as by a dot-probe task. The comprehensive set of predictor variables included measures of affective and bodily distress (depression, anxiety and somatization), experimental pain sensitivity, and cortisol reactivity. Directed relationships were estimated by using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Structural equation modelling revealed a significant path from affective and bodily distress to self-reported maladaptive attentional and emotional pain processing. In contrast, the paths from pain sensitivity and cortisol reactivity did not reach the level of significance. CONCLUSION: These results support the position that anxiety and depression, as well as somatization, contribute to the aberrance of attentional and emotional mechanisms of pain processing. Surprisingly, the assumption of a close relationship between these maladaptive mechanisms of pain processing and pain sensitivity could not be confirmed. ©2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

While much research has shown a link between covert attention and saccade preparation, the nature of that link remains a matter of dispute. Covert presaccadic orienting could result from target selection or from planning a motor act toward an object. We examined the contribution of visual target selection and motor preparation to attentional orienting in humans by dissociating these two habitually aligned processes with saccadic adaptation. Adaptation introduces a discrepancy between the visual target evoking a saccade and the motor metrics of that saccade, which, unbeknownst to the participant, brings the eyes to a different spatial location. We examined attentional orienting by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) to task-irrelevant visual probes fl ashed during saccade preparation at four equidistant locations including the visual target location and the upcoming motor endpoint. ERPs as early as 130-170 ms post-probe were modulated by attention at both the visual target and motor endpoint locations. These results indicate that both target selection and motor preparation determine the focus of spatial attention, resulting in enhanced processing of stimuli at early visual-perceptual stages. © 2010 Collins, Heed and Röder.","Attention; ERP; Human; Saccade","adult; article; attention; controlled study; distance perception; event related potential; evoked visual response; female; human; human experiment; male; mental task; motor activity; neuromodulation; saccadic eye movement; sensorimotor function; spatial discrimination; vision; visual adaptation; visual orientation; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952999558

Indeed, unmasked snakes and spiders modulate spatial attention. Yet, it is unclear if the rapid threat-related facilitation of spatial attention to backward masked stimuli is elicited by non-face threat cues. Evolutionary theories claim that phylogenetic threats (i.e. snakes and spiders) should preferentially elicit an automatic fear response, but it is untested as to whether this response extends to enhancements in spatial attention under restricted processing conditions. Thirty individuals completed a backward masking dot-probe task with both evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threat cues.

As predicted, habitual chocolate cravers (Experiment 1) and individuals in whom a craving for chocolate was temporarily induced (Experiment 2) showed speeded detection of probes replacing chocolate-related pictures, demonstrating an attentional bias for chocolate cues.

This study investigates whether adolescent patients with a diagnosis of BPD demonstrate abnormalities in attentional maintenance in viewing emotional faces. Sampling and Methods: Thirty female adolescents with a diagnosis of BPD, 29 female adolescents with mixed psychiatric diagnoses, and 30 healthy participants were tested with the visual dot probe task. The task involved showing photographs of actors with faces depicting neutral, negative, and positive expressions for 1,500 ms each. Results: Attentional bias to negative faces was not generally associated with BPD, but patients with BPD did show a strong correlation between current mood and attentional bias to negative faces. Only in adolescents with BPD did attention to negative faces narrow when they were currently in a state of negative mood. Conversely, both control groups avoided negative faces in conjunction with a decline in positive mood. Conclusions: This study indicates that borderline pathology is linked to an inability to disengage attention from negative facial expressions during attentional maintenance when in a negative mood. Based on these findings, mood-dependent therapeutic interventions focusing on attentional processes may represent a useful add-on to established therapies in patients with BPD. © 2009 S.

The plasma gun is used for experimental studies of magnetic bubble expansion into a lower pressure background plasma as a laboratory model for extragalactic radio lobe expansion into the interstellar medium. The gun is powered by a 120μ F, 10kV ignitron-switched capacitor bank. High-pressure gas is puffed into an annular gap between inner and outer coaxial electrodes. The applied high voltage ionizes the gas and creates a radial current sheet. The ∼100kA discharge current generates toroidal flux and poloidal flux is provided by an external bias magnetic field. Axial JxB force then ejects plasma out of the gun. If the JxB force exceeds the magnetic tension of the poloidal flux by a sufficient amount then a detached magnetized plasma bubble will be formed. Using a multi-tip Langmuir probe array, a high speed camera and a B-dot probe array, the evolution of this plasma ""bubble"" as it interacts with pre-existing low pressure background plasma, is studied. In particular, details of the plasma bubble formation system including the main gun cap-bank power system, gas valve control system, bias flux cap-bank power system, and experimental data are provided. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Annular gap; B-dot probe; Bias magnetic field; Coaxial electrodes; Discharge currents; Experimental data; Experimental studies; Gas valves; Hardware system; High pressure gas; High voltage; Interstellar mediums; Laboratory models; Langmuir probe arrays; Low pressures; Lower pressures; Magnetized plasmas; Plasma bubble formation; Poloidal flux; Power systems; Radial currents; Radio lobes; Switched capacitor banks; Toroidal flux; Capacitors; Magnetic bubbles; Magnetic fields; Magnetoplasma; Plasma guns; Probes; Electric discharges",,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949964771

Attention training comprised a probe detection task in which pictures of faces with either a threatening or neutral emotional expression cued different locations on the computer screen. In the attention modification program (AMP), participants responded to a probe that always followed neutral faces when paired with a threatening face, thereby directing attention away from threat. In the attention control condition (ACC), the probe appeared with equal frequency in the position of the threatening and neutral faces. Results revealed that the AMP facilitated attention disengagement from threat from pre- to postassessment and reduced clinician- and self-reported symptoms of social anxiety relative to the ACC.

The current study aimed to examine whether such bias was also present when subjects were unaware of the presented stimuli and the possible role of awareness modulation on attentional bias. With a psychophysical approach (interocular suppression), we suppressed subjects' awareness to the cigarette pictures presented to one of their eyes. The visual dot probe task was modified to increase the perceptual load and to control the physical features between two rivaling images. Twenty-eight male smokers and 25 male non-smokers participated in the experiment. We found a significant interaction between experiment conditions and subject groups, with only the smoker group showed attentional bias toward cigarette pictures in unaware condition. Moreover, smokers' attentional bias in unaware condition was negatively correlated with their scores on Cigarette Dependence Scale while their attentional bias in aware condition was positively correlated with scores on Questionnaires of Smoking Urges. Such dissociation indicates the possibility of awareness modulation on attentional bias: it is possible that in aware condition, the attentional bias was modulated by smoking urge in awareness, thus concealed the effect of dependence degree. Further studies indicated that awareness modulated attentional bias through many factors, such as craving, quit attempt, attitude and disgust. Interestingly, non-smokers also showed attentional bias in aware condition, which further suggested that due to awareness modulation, attentional bias could even be addiction-unrelated. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Addiction; Awareness; CDS; QSU-brief; Tobacco; WISMD-68","adult; article; attentional bias; attitude; awareness; Cigarette Dependence Scale; cigarette smoking; clinical article; controlled study; experiment; experimental study; human; image display; male; modulation; priority journal; questionnaire; Questionnaires of Smoking Urge; scoring system; stimulus response; withdrawal syndrome; Attention; Awareness; Consciousness; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Smoking; Tobacco Use Disorder; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70049099569

However, virtually no research examines such age-related differences in the neural circuitry supporting attention orienting to emotional faces. We examined age-related correlations in attention-orienting biases to positive and negative face emotions in a healthy sample (N = 37; 9-40 years old) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a dot-probe task. The dot-probe task in an fMRI setting yields both behavioral and neural indices of attention biases towards or away from an emotional cue (happy or angry face). In the full sample, angry-face attention bias scores did not correlate with age, and age did not correlate with brain activation to angry faces. However, age did positively correlate with attention bias towards happy faces; age also negatively correlated with left cuneus and left caudate activation to a happy bias fMRI contrast. Secondary analyses suggested age-related changes in attention bias to happy faces. The tendency in younger children to direct attention away from happy faces (relative to neutral faces) was diminished in the older age groups, in tandem with increasing neural deactivation. Implications for future work on developmental changes in attention-emotion processing are discussed.","Affect; Attention; Development; Emotion; Face; fMRI","adolescent; adult; article; attention; brain depth stimulation; child; electroencephalogram; emotionality; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; nerve cell; nerve cell differentiation; normal human; priority journal; school child; Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Adult; Aging; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Child Development; Cues; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Social Perception; Young Adult","NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health; NIH, National Institutes of Health","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449084507

Furthermore, we investigated the influence of pre-treatment alcohol consumption and abstinence duration onto alcohol-related attentional bias. Methods: We used an alcohol-visual-dot-probe-task with two different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to examine processes of initial orienting and maintenance of attention separately (50 and 500 ms SOA). Results: With short SOA, we found a positive attentional bias towards alcohol cues in alcohol-dependent patients and light social drinkers that was positively associated with pre-treatment alcohol consumption in alcoholics. Using a longer SOA, a negative attentional bias was found in light social drinkers and in patients abstinent for more than 2 weeks indicating alcohol stimuli avoidance. In patients, we found a negative correlation between attentional bias and duration of abstinence. Conclusions: After initial visual orienting towards alcohol-related stimuli, light social drinkers as well as longer abstinent alcohol-dependent patients disengage their attention. In patients, this disengagement increased during the first 3 weeks after detoxification indicating assimilation to the attentional bias pattern of light social drinkers. © The Author 2009.

Eye movements and reaction time to food and non-food images were recorded during both fasted and fed conditions in a counterbalanced design. Eating behavior and hunger level were assessed by self-report measures. Obese individuals had higher scores than normal-weight individuals on self-report measures of responsiveness to external food cues and vulnerability to disruptions in control of eating behavior. Both obese and normal-weight individuals demonstrated increased gaze duration for food compared to non-food images in the fasted condition. In the fed condition, however, despite reduced hunger in both groups, obese individuals maintained the increased attention to food images, whereas normal-weight individuals had similar gaze duration for food and non-food images. Additionally, obese individuals had preferential orienting toward food images at the onset of each image. Obese and normal-weight individuals did not differ in reaction time measures in the fasted or fed condition.Conclusions/Significance:Food cue incentive salience is elevated equally in normal-weight and obese individuals during fasting. Obese individuals retain incentive salience for food cues despite feeding and decreased self-report of hunger.

In real-life environments, however, humans typically encounter simultaneous input to several different senses, such as vision and audition. As multiple signals entering different channels might originate from a common, emotionally relevant source, the prioritization of emotional stimuli should be able to operate across modalities. In this study, we explored cross-modal emotional attention. Spatially localized utterances with emotional and neutral prosody served as cues for a visually presented target in a cross-modal dot-probe task. Participants were faster to respond to targets that appeared at the spatial location of emotional compared to neutral prosody. Eventrelated brain potentials revealed emotional modulation of early visual target processing at the level of the P1 component, with neural sources in the striate visual cortex being more active for targets that appeared at the spatial location of emotional compared to neutral prosody. These effects were not found using synthesized control sounds matched for mean fundamental frequency and amplitude envelope.

Individuals with social phobia are at an increased risk to develop alcohol problems. However, the mechanism responsible for this association is unclear. It has been suggested that alcohol reduces anxiety by impairing initial appraisal of threatening stimuli. Information that is especially threatening, however, may be resistant to such an effect of alcohol. We tested the influence of alcohol on the appraisal of five emotional facial expressions. Methods. 40 social phobia patients and 40 controls performed a dot probe task, after drinking either alcohol or orange juice. Stimuli were faces with happy, angry, neutral and also two ambiguous expressions that were formed by blending angry or happy faces and neutral faces. Stimuli were presented for either 175 or 600 ms. Result. Sober patients showed an attentional bias towards angry faces, indicating preferential processing of threat stimuli. Alcohol significantly reduced this bias. Only in sober participants, this attentional bias correlated with measures of social anxiety. In controls, no biases were observed. Conclusions. Alcohol seems to attenuate the impact of threatening social stimuli on social phobia patients, which may negatively reinforce the consumption of alcohol and at least partially explain the heightened comorbidity with alcohol related problems known from epidemiological studies. The dot probe task with short stimulus presentation times seems to provide an adequate method to demonstrate alcohol effects on information processing. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.",,"alcohol; alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; anger; anxiety disorder; article; clinical article; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; drinking behavior; eating disorder; emotionality; facial expression; female; happiness; human; male; orange juice; priority journal; social phobia; stimulus; task performance; alcoholism; attention; blood; comparative study; decision making; drinking behavior; drug effect; emotion; phobia; physiology; psychological aspect; recognition; reinforcement; vision; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Anger; Attention; Comorbidity; Emotions; Ethanol; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Phobic Disorders; Recognition (Psychology); Reinforcement (Psychology); Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649211367

Results: The ABM produced the predicted changes in attentional bias, although these effects were short lasting, and there was no evidence of generalization either to novel smoking-related stimuli or to performance on a different measure of attentional bias (the pictorial Stroop task). ABM had no effects on subjective craving or behavioral measures of tobacco seeking. Discussion: These results add to a growing body of literature that suggests that a single session of ABM does not produce generalizable effects, and effects on craving and drug seeking are inconsistent across studies.

Previous studies investigating attentional biases in social anxiety disorder (SAD) have yielded mixed results. Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies using the dot-probe paradigm in non-anxious participants have shown that the P1 component is sensitive to visuospatial attention towards emotional faces. We used a dot-probe task in conjunction with high-density ERPs and source localization to investigate attentional biases in SAD. Method. Twelve SAD and 15 control participants performed a modified dot-probe task using angry-neutral and happy-neutral face pairs. The P1 component elicited by face pairs was analyzed to test the hypothesis that SAD participants would display early hypervigilance to threat-related cues. The P1 component to probes replacing angry, happy or neutral faces was used to evaluate whether SAD participants show either sustained hypervigilance or decreased visual processing of threat-related cues at later processing stages. Results. Compared to controls, SAD participants showed relatively (a) potentiated P1 amplitudes and fusiform gyrus (FG) activation to angry-neutral versus happy-neutral face pairs; (b) decreased P1 amplitudes to probes replacing emotional (angry and happy) versus neutral faces; and (c) higher sensitivity (d′) to probes following angry-neutral versus happy-neutral face pairs. SAD participants also showed significantly shorter reaction times (RTs) to probes replacing angry versus happy faces, but no group differences emerged for RT. Conclusions. The results provide electrophysiological support for early hypervigilance to angry faces in SAD with involvement of the FG, and reduced visual processing of emotionally salient locations at later stages of information processing, which might be a manifestation of attentional avoidance. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Anger; Attention; Electrophysiology; Faces; Hypervigilance-avoidance hypothesis; Social anxiety disorder; Social phobia","paroxetine; sertraline; venlafaxine; adult; alertness; analytic method; article; avoidance behavior; clinical article; controlled study; electroencephalography; emotion; event related potential; facial expression; female; human; hypervigilance; low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis; male; positron emission tomography; reaction time; selective attention; social phobia; task performance; temporal lobe; threat; tissue distribution; anger; arousal; association; attention; electroencephalography; emotion; evoked response; facial expression; hemispheric dominance; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; perceptive threshold; phobia; physiology; psychological aspect; reference value; signal processing; Adult; Anger; Arousal; Attention; Cues; Dominance, Cerebral; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evoked Potentials; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Phobic Disorders; Reaction Time; Reference Values; Sensory Thresholds; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249217876

We wished to test the hypothesis that these models would also be able to detect agents likely to cause depression as an adverse effect. The anti-obesity drug and cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, is associated with significant rates of depression and anxiety in clinical use. Materials and methods: Thirty healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of rimonabant (20 mg) or lactose placebo in a double-blind, between-groups design. Three hours after medication administration, subjects undertook an emotional processing test battery including facial emotion recognition, emotional word attentional dot probe, self-relevant word classification, emotional and declarative memory and the emotion-potentiated acoustic startle response. Subjective state was assessed via self-report measures. Results: A single dose of rimonabant did not alter subjective mood. However, rimonabant selectively reduced incidental recall of positive self-relevant adjectives, an effect contrary to that seen following the administration of antidepressants. There were no effects of rimonabant on the other measures of emotional processing. Conclusions: These results suggest that a single dose of rimonabant decreases positive emotional memory in the absence of changes in subjective state.

Few studies examine how these two neurochemical systems interact to influence anxiety and attention in humans. Objective: The objective of this paper is to examine the effects of exogenous yohimbine and hydrocortisone, as well as their combination (Y∈+∈H), on panic symptoms and attention to social threat cues. Methods: Thirty-two healthy adults underwent a pharmacological challenge in which they were blindly randomized to either yohimbine, hydrocortisone, Y∈+∈H, or placebo. Thirty minutes after drug infusion, attention to threat was measured using the dot probe task, a visual attention task that presents angry, happy, and neutral faces and measures the degree of attention allocated towards or away from the emotional faces. Panic and autonomic measures were assessed before and 30 min after drug infusion. Results: There was a significant increase in panic symptoms in the yohimbine and Y∈+∈H groups, but not in the hydrocortisone or placebo groups. Yohimbine resulted in a greater increase in panic symptoms than Y∈+∈H. On the dot probe task, the placebo group exhibited an attention bias to angry faces, whereas this bias was absent after yohimbine.

This effect is said to occur because the locations of the old items are inhibited before the new items appear. The present study used a probe-detection task to examine whether this inhibition occurs only at the precise locations of old items or at and around the locations of old items. We also investigated the effect of inhibition overreaching boundaries to encompass neighboring regions. Participants searched for a target or detected a probe that appeared after the new items appeared. The results revealed that the probe reaction times at locations inside grouped regions were longer than those at a blank region where no items had been presented and were comparable to those at a location occupied by old items. Probe detection was not delayed when the probe was presented near but external to the external boundary of the grouped regions. The overreaching effect was obtained before and after the new items appeared. We conclude that the inhibitory template for visual marking represents clusters of old items for at least 200 ms before the onset of new items, and that this spatial schema is preserved until at least 200 ms after the onset of new items. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Selective attention for threat when measured with a probe detection task is interpreted as an attentional shift toward threat (""vigilance""). Yet, there is data that show socially anxious individuals may have difficulty in shifting their attention away from threat (""disengagement""; Amir, Elias, Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003). A step toward clarifying the extent to which selective attention for threat comprises vigilance or disengagement effects is described by Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, and de Houwer (2004). We adapted their modified probe detection task to examine vigilance and disengagement effects for threat and happy faces in individuals with and without social anxiety. The results indicate that socially anxious individuals exhibit vigilance for threat faces, but not for happy faces, compared to individuals without social anxiety.

Given the severity of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and the considerable number of clients who do not respond to traditional therapies, understanding the factors that maintain anxiety in OCD is critical for the development of effective treatments. This study investigated attentional biases in a homogenous group of OCD patients whose primary concern was checking (OCD-Check; n = 18) compared to a Control group individually matched for age, gender and level of education (Control; n = 18) using a dot probe task. No evidence of attentional bias, or of differences in orienting to or disengaging from checking-relevant stimuli, was found in the OCD group compared to the matched Control group. From this data, it would appear that attentional bias may not be a feature of obsessive compulsive checking.

One possibility involves interactions between reactive and effortful components of temperament, as well as cognitive factors, like attentional biases to threat stimuli. This study tested a predicted relation between high levels of NA, low levels of effortful control (EC), and an attentional bias toward threat in children.

Attentional bias was assessed in 30 alcohol-dependent patients using a visual dot-probe task with a picture presentation time of 50 ms. In addition, patients completed a variety of different cognitive tasks such as attention, continuous performance, working memory, set shifting and inhibitory control tests.

When impairment of attention and working memory were controlled for, the group differences in attentional bias were no longer significant.

Changes in implicit associations do not occur simultaneously to Pavlovian conditioning of physiological anxiety responses.

Participants next completed a visual probe task in which the angry face CS+ and CS- stimuli were paired with angry face control stimuli and neutral faces. Results confirmed that differential fear conditioning was observed in the Shock group but not in the NoShock group, and that the Shock group subsequently showed a selective attentional bias for the angry face CS+ compared with the CS- and control stimuli during the visual probe task.

Moreover, androstadienone did not alter positive or negative mood, as participants were alone during testing, which removed emotional stimuli from social interactions with a tester.

The pain-related stimuli used in these studies have been primarily verbal in nature (i.e., words depicting themes of pain). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients with chronic pain, relative to healthy controls, show selective attention for pictures depicting painful faces. To do so, 170 patients with chronic pain and 40 age- and education-matched healthy control participants were tested using a dot-probe task in which painful, happy, and neutral facial expressions were presented. Selective attention was denoted using the mean reaction time and the bias index. Results indicated that, while both groups shifted attention away from happy faces (and towards neutral faces), only the control group shifted attention away from painful faces. Additional analyses were conducted on chronic pain participants after dividing them into groups on the basis of fear of pain/(re)injury. The results of these analyses revealed that while chronic pain patients with high and low levels of fear both shifted attention away from happy faces, those with low fear shifted attention away from painful faces, whereas those with high fear shifted attention towards painful faces. These results suggest that patients with chronic pain selectively attend to facial expressions of pain and, importantly, that the tendency to shift attention towards such stimuli is positively influenced by high fear of pain/(re)injury.

The attention-intention-effort pathway in the development of psychophysiological insomnia: a theoretical review. Sleep Medicine Reviews, 10, 215-245] propose a route into psychophysiological insomnia along the attention-intention-effort pathway which focuses on the inhibition of sleep-wake automaticity. A contributing factor to this is selective attention to sleep (alongside explicit intention to sleep and effort in the sleep engagement process). Following on from previous work on selective attention to sleep [Marchetti, L. M., Biello, S. M., Broomfield, N. M., MacMahon, K. M. A., & Espie, C. A. (2006). Who is pre-occupied with sleep?.

A cognitive model of insomnia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 40, 869-893], a cognitive probe task was employed to investigate further the role of the clock as a focus of selective attention in those with primary insomnia. A 2 × 2 between participants design comparing reaction time of individuals with primary insomnia (n = 22) and normal sleepers (n = 22) on a modified Posner paradigm. Responses obtained from a computer task presenting times which fall within a normal sleep period were analysed. Individuals with primary insomnia demonstrated delayed disengagement to the clock (F(1,84) = 6.9, p < 0.05) which is taken as further support for previous research demonstrating that individuals with primary insomnia exhibit an attentional bias to sleep related stimuli. These results lend support to the attention-intention-effort model (Espie et al., 2006) and the cognitive model (Harvey, 2002) both of which recognise the importance of selective attention towards salient stimuli in the maintenance of insomnia. Possible clinical implications of attentional bias to sleep as a marker of psychopathology progression and treatment efficacy are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study tested this hypothesis using a visual dot-probe task with idiographic word selection.

Participants completed a probe detection task by identifying letters (E or F) replacing one member of a pair of words. The authors trained attention by including a contingency between the location of the probe and the nonthreat word in one group (Attention Modification Program; AMP) and not in the other (attention control condition; ACC). Participants in the AMP showed change in attention bias and a decrease in anxiety, as indicated by both self-report and interviewer measures. These effects were not present in the ACC group.

It is unclear to what extent this relationship can be explained by genetic or environmental factors. Method: The genetic relationship between a neuroticism composite score and free recall of pleasant and unpleasant words and the reaction time on negative probes (dot-probe task) was investigated in 125 female twin pairs. Interaction effects were modelled to test whether the correlation between neuroticism and cognitive measures depended on the level of the neuroticism score. Results: The only significant correlation was between neuroticism and the proportion of recalled unpleasant words (heritability is 30%), and was only detectable at the higher end of the neuroticism distribution. This interaction effect seems to be due to environmental effects that make people in the same family more similar (e.g. parental discipline style), rather than genetic factors. An interesting sub-finding was that faster reaction times for left versus right visual field probes in the dot-probe task suggest that cognitive processing in the right hemisphere is more sensitive to subliminal (biologically relevant) cues and that this characteristic is under substantial genetic control (49%). Individual differences in reaction times on right visual field probes were due to environmental effects only. Conclusions: There is no evidence that the predisposition of individuals to focus on negative (emotional) stimuli is a possible underlying genetic mechanism of neuroticism. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Dot-probe task; Heritability; Moderator effects; Neuroticism; Recall bias","adult; article; association; attention; biology; cognition; correlational study; emotion; environment; family; female; genetic regulation; genetics; heredity; heritability; human; male; molecular phylogeny; neurosis; reaction time; recall; recall bias; right hemisphere; scoring system; stimulus; task performance; twins; visual field; adolescent; genetic predisposition; neurosis; perceptive threshold; psychological aspect; recall; twins; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Cues; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Mental Recall; Neurotic Disorders; Reaction Time; Subliminal Stimulation; Task Performance and Analysis; Twins; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-62249181671

Specific components of selective attention were examined in treatment responders and nonresponders. Method: Participants consisted of 131 children with anxiety disorders (aged 8-16 years), who received standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy. At pretreatment, a pictorial dot-probe task was administered to assess selective attention. Both at pretreatment and posttreatment, diagnostic status of the children was evaluated with a semistructured clinical interview (the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children). Results: Selective attention for severely threatening pictures at pretreatment assessment was predictive of treatment success.

Its usefulness as predisposing factor for the development and maintenance of pain has been discussed. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the predictive power of hypervigilance for the development of acute postoperative pain. Methods: Fifty-four young male patients were assessed 1 day before surgery (correction of chest malformation) on a range of psychologic predictors. These predictors included the assessment of hypervigilance (questionnaires as the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale, the Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire, and the dot-probe task) and affective state, experimental pain sensitivity, and cortisol reactivity. Acute postoperative pain was assessed by ratings of pain intensity 1 week postsurgery and through the amount of analgesics [patientcontrolled epidural analgesia (PCEA)] requested during the first days after surgery. Results: Pain intensity was significantly explained (17% explained variance) by hypervigilance, whereas PCEA performance was not (10%). Adding all other predictors led to a significant increase of explained variance (35%) for pain ratings and a nonsignificant increase (19%) for PCEA. A more parsimonious solution with only heat pain threshold added led to a significant increase in explained variance (30%) for pain intensity. Hypervigilance was only moderately correlated with the other predictors. Discussion: Hypervigilance proved to be a powerful predictor of subjective acute postoperative pain, but was less useful with regard to the amount of requested analgesics. The overlap with other psychologic predictors (affective state, experimental pain sensitivity, and cortisol reactivity) is sufficiently small to consider hypervigilance a promising supplement in psychologic predictor research. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Hypervigilance; Postoperative pain; Predictor","alfentanil; dexketoprofen; hydrocortisone; morphine; paracetamol; ropivacaine; sufentanil; hydrocortisone; adolescent; adult; affect; article; attention; controlled study; human; major clinical study; male; nociception; pain assessment; pain hypervigilance; pain threshold; patient controlled analgesia; postoperative pain; predictor variable; priority journal; questionnaire; affect; arousal; attention; metabolism; methodology; pain threshold; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative pain; prediction and forecasting; psychological aspect; psychological rating scale; regression analysis; saliva; time; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Arousal; Attention; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold; Pain, Postoperative; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Saliva; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67049165528

Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging technique as well as Block and Dot-probe event-related stimulating modes were used to compare and analyze images obtained from fMRI-BOLD technique before and after electroacupuncture intervention. Results: In the attention shift task, significantly stronger activation intensity was shown in the dorsolateral frontal cortexes, inferior frontal gyri, anterior cingulate cortexes and left corpus striatum after electroacupuncture treatment. In the attentional bias task, after electroacupuncture treatment, the activation volume of the dorsolateral areas of the left frontal lobe decreased significantly, and the activation intensity of the right superior parietal lobule increased. Conclusions: Heroin abstainers showed significantly higher attentional bias to visual drug-related cue than to positive and negative emotional cues, and they had higher attentional bias to the processing of negative emotion than to the positive emotional cue. Electroacupuncture intervention could obviously lower the attention level of heroin abstainers to the drug-related cue, inhibit the susceptibility of heroin abstainers to negative emotion and promote the rehabilitation of cognitive function of emotion of the brain. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","cognitive attention; Drug-related cue; Electroacupuncture; functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI); Heroin abstinent","Activation volume; Attention level; Before and after; Cognitive attention; Cognitive functions; Compare and analyze; Cortexes; Drug-related cue; Frontal lobes; Functional changes; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Heroin abstinent; Neural mechanisms; Striatum; Biochemical engineering; Brain; Electroacupuncture; Resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging",,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-64549125890

It is known that the vacuum surface of the insulator will flashover when illuminated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation depending on the insulator material, insulator cone angle, applied voltage and insulator shot-history. A testbed comprised of an excimer laser (KrF, 248 nm, ∼2 MW/cm2, 30 ns FWHM,), a vacuum chamber (low 1.0E-6 torr), and dc high voltage power supply (&lt;60 kV) was assembled for insulator testing to measure the UV dose during a flashover event. Five in-house developed and calibrated fast D-Dot probes ( &gt;12 GHz, bandwidth) were embedded in the anode electrode underneath the insulator to determine the time of flashover with respect to UV arrival. A commercial energy meter were used to measure the UV fluence for each pulse. Four insulator materials High Density Polyethylene, Rexolite® 1400, Macor TM and Mycalex with side- angles of 0, ±30, and ±45 degrees, 1.0 cm thick samples, were tested with a maximum UV fluence of 75 mJ/cm2 and at varying electrode charge (10 kV to 60 kV). This information clarified/corrected earlier published studies. A new phenomenon was observed related to the UV power level on flashover that as the UV pulse intensity was increased, the UV fluence on the insulator prior to flashover was also increased. This effect would bias the data towards higher minimum flashover fluence. © 2008 IEEE.",,"DC generators; Electric power transmission networks; Excimer lasers; Gas lasers; Insulating materials; Krypton; Modulators; Vacuum; Anode electrodes; Applied voltages; Commercial energies; Cone angles; Critical components; DC high voltages; Electrode charges; Fluence; High energies; Insulator flashovers; Insulator materials; Power levels; Pulse intensities; Pulsed power systems; Test beds; Thick samples; Ultra violets; UV dose; UV fluence; Uv induced; Vacuum chambers; Flashover",,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-62949146605

We investigated whether attentional bias for smoking-related stimuli could be altered using a modified visual probe task in cigarette smokers. We also sought to determine whether changes in attentional bias were associated with changes in subsequent craving and cue reactivity. Participants: Male and female (n = 54) current smokers (≥5 cigarettes per day), aged between 18 and 40 years, were recruited from staff and students of the University of Bristol, and from the general population. Design: Participants attended a single test session and completed an attentional training procedure in which they were either trained to attend to smoking-related pictorial stimuli (attend group) or to neutral pictorial stimuli (avoid group). Group allocation was randomized. Measurements: Following attentional training, participants underwent a smoking cue exposure procedure in which they were exposed to smoking-related stimuli. Subjective measures of mood and craving were taken at baseline and before and after cue exposure. Participants then smoked a cigarette and smoking topography was measured. Findings: Attentional training increased attentional bias among participants in the attend group, and decreased attentional bias among those in the avoid group. There were also differences between the attend and avoid groups in post-training changes in craving during exposure to in vivo smoking cues, reflecting greater increases in craving in the attend group, although these effects were observed in males only. Conclusions: These data are the first to show alterations in attentional bias for smoking-related stimuli following a modified visual probe training procedure. Furthermore, post-training group differences in subjective craving suggest potential clinical utility of training procedures, although these effects may operate only in males. Future research should investigate whether multiple training sessions enhance post-training reductions in craving and cue reactivity, and the longer-term persistence of training effects. © 2008 The Authors.","Attentional bias; Attentional training; Cigarette smoking; Craving; Cue reactivity; Visual probe","adult; anxiety; article; association; attention; awareness; cigarette smoking; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; mood; normal human; systematic error; training; visual analog scale; withdrawal syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Conditioning (Psychology); Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-54049114249

The attention-grabbing properties of drugs to drug-using individuals have been well documented and recent research has begun to suggest that such attentional bias may be related to the severity of drug dependency. Dependence on ketamine has been reported anecdotally but no systematic study has investigated this phenomenon. We aimed to explore attentional biases to incentive stimuli in different populations of ketamine users. Method. Using a dot-probe paradigm, attentional bias to both drug-related and money-related stimuli was investigated in 150 participants: 30 frequent ketamine users, 30 infrequent ketamine users, 30 ex-ketamine users, 30 poly-drug users and 30 non-drug-using controls. Two stimulus presentation times were used (200 and 2000 ms) to investigate whether attentional bias was as a result of an automatic or a more conscious attentional shift. Participants also rated the degree to which stimuli used in the dot-probe paradigm were pleasurable. Results. Frequent ketamine users demonstrated an attentional bias to both types of incentive stimuli only at the short stimulus presentation interval and this was significantly correlated with degree of ketamine use. No attentional biases were observed in any of the other groups. All groups rated money stimuli as more pleasurable than neutral stimuli. Conclusions. These data support incentive models of drug use and demonstrate the ability of the attentional bias paradigm to discriminate recreational drug users from those with more dependent patterns of use.

Specifically, using a dot-probe detection paradigm, White participants revealed biased attention toward Black faces relative to White faces (Study 1). Because the faces were presented only briefly (30-ms), the bias is thought to reflect the early engagement of attention. The attentional bias was eliminated, however, when the faces displayed averted eye-gaze (Study 2). That is, when the threat communicated by the Black faces was attenuated by a relevant, competing socio-emotional cue-in this case, averted eye-gaze-they no longer captured perceivers' attention.

However, attentional biases are not unique to addiction (e.g., they are also found for emotional information). This study examined whether attentional and approach biases in cigarette smokers are mediated by the motivational salience of cues (relevance to drug-taking), rather than by their affective properties (subjective liking of the cues). Cues included pleasant and unpleasant smoking-related pictures. Attentional biases, approach tendencies and subjective evaluation of the cues were assessed on visual probe, stimulus-response compatibility and rating tasks, respectively. Compared with non-smokers, smokers showed a greater attentional bias for both pleasant and unpleasant smoking-related cues presented for 2000 ms, but not for 200 ms. Smokers showed a greater approach bias for unpleasant cues, although the groups did not differ significantly in approach bias for pleasant smoking-related cues. Smokers rated both pleasant and unpleasant smoking pictures more positively than did non-smokers. Results suggest that a bias to maintain attention on smoking-related cues in young adult smokers is primarily a function of drug-relevance, rather than affective properties, of the cues.

However, the effects of the anxiolytic diazepam have typically been examined at sedative doses, which do not allow the direct actions on emotional processing to be fully separated from global effects of the drug on cognition and alertness. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a lower, but still clinically effective, dose of diazepam on emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods: Twenty-four participants were randomised to receive a single dose of diazepam (5 mg) or placebo. Sixty minutes later, participants completed a battery of psychological tests, including measures of non-emotional cognitive performance (reaction time and sustained attention) and emotional processing (affective modulation of the startle reflex, attentional dot probe, facial expression recognition, and emotional memory). Mood and subjective experience were also measured. Results: Diazepam significantly modulated attentional vigilance to masked emotional faces and significantly decreased overall startle reactivity. Diazepam did not significantly affect mood, alertness, response times, facial expression recognition, or sustained attention. Conclusions: At non-sedating doses, diazepam produces effects on attentional vigilance and startle responsivity that are consistent with its anxiolytic action. This may be an underlying mechanism through which benzodiazepines exert their therapeutic effects in clinical anxiety. © 2008 The Author(s).","Attentional bias; Diazepam; Emotional processing; Facial expression recognition; Healthy volunteers; Startle","diazepam; placebo; adult; alertness; article; attention; Beck Depression Inventory; Buss Durkee hostility inventory; cognition; demography; dysfunctional attitudes scale; emotion; Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; facial expression; female; human; human experiment; male; memory; mood; normal human; priority journal; psychologic test; rating scale; response time; single drug dose; startle reflex; statistical analysis; tranquilizing activity; volunteer; Adult; Attention; Diazepam; Double-Blind Method; Electromyography; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Male; Memory; Mental Recall; Perception; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Serotonin; Social Perception; Young Adult","Wellcome Trust","Acknowledgements SEM is supported by a Wellcome Trust studentship.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-48149096545

Additionally, backward masking studies commonly use a neutral face as the mask stimulus. This method results in greater perceptual inconsistencies for fearful as opposed to neutral faces. Therefore, it is currently unclear whether the effects of backward masked fearful faces are due to the fearful nature of the face or perceptual inconsistencies. Equally unclear, is whether this spatial attention effect is due to orienting or disengagement. Two modified dot probe experiments with neutral (closed mouth in Experiment 1) and smiling (open mouth in Experiment 2) masks were used to determine the role of perceptual inconsistencies in mediating the spatial attention effects elicited by masked fearful faces. The results indicate that masked fearful faces modulate the orienting of spatial attention, and it appears that this effect is due to the fearful nature of the face rather than perceptual inconsistencies between the initial faces and masks. © 2008 American Psychological Association.","backward masking; faces; fear, and emotion; spatial attention","article; attention; emotion; facial expression; fear; female; human; human experiment; male; masking; normal human; response time; spatial orientation; stimulus response; visual field; Adult; Attention; Face; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Perceptual Masking; Reaction Time; Space Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849120734

The present study sought to examine the utility of the inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm for assessing attentional bias in social anxiety. Unlike other existing paradigms such as the emotional Stroop or dot-probe tasks, the IB paradigm has the advantage of eliminating the individual's expectation and intention to search for social cues, which would reduce strategic or effortful responses. Two independent experiments were conducted using college students scoring high or low on the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale. In both Experiments 1 and 2, participants were randomized to one of three IB experiment conditions, in which a positive face, a negative face, or a neutral item was unexpectedly presented, in the presence/absence of a bogus-speech threat. The overall pattern of our data suggests the presence of hypervigilant attentional processing in social anxiety. The IB paradigm appears to be a useful addition to existing experiment paradigms for investigating attentional bias in social anxiety and perhaps other psychopathology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This modulation is often explained in terms of a fear module. Appraisal theories of emotion posit a more general mechanism, predicting attention capture by stimuli that are relevant for the needs and goals of the organism, regardless of valence. To examine the brain-activation patterns underlying attentional modulation, we recorded event-related potentials from 20 subjects performing a dot-probe task in which the cues were fear-inducing and nurturance-inducing stimuli (i.e., anger faces and baby faces). Highly similar validity modulation was found for the P1 time-locked to target onset, indicating early attentional capture by both positive and negative emotional stimuli. Topographic segmentation analysis and source localization indicate that the same amplification process is involved whether attention orienting is triggered by negative, fear-relevant stimuli or positive, nurturance-relevant stimuli. These results confirm that biological relevance, and not exclusively fear, produces an automatic spatial orienting toward the location of a stimulus.

This leads to increased appetitive motivation to drink alcohol as measured by subjective craving and cognitive biases such as attentional bias and approach bias. Although these measures relate to the same construct, correlations between these variables are often very low. Alcohol consumption might not only increase different aspects of appetitive motivation, but also correlations between those aspects. Objectives: To investigate the effect of a low alcohol dose on changes in various measures of appetitive motivation. Materials and methods: Twenty-three heavy social drinkers were tested in 2 sessions, once after receiving an alcohol prime dose and once after receiving a placebo drink. After drink administration, attentional bias was measured with a visual-probe task using concurrent eye movement monitoring. Furthermore, we measured the approach bias with a stimulus response compatibility task and subjective craving with the Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire. Results: After the alcohol prime dose, participants had higher levels of craving and more pronounced attentional bias (faster reaction times to probes that replaced alcohol rather than control pictures, increased maintenance of gaze on alcohol pictures, and a higher percentage of first eye movements directed toward alcohol pictures). Approach bias was not influenced by the alcohol prime dose. The correlation between attentional bias and approach bias was significantly higher after the alcohol than after the placebo drink. Conclusions: A low alcohol dose increased most measures of appetitive motivation for alcohol and increased the interrelation between cognitive measures of this construct. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Alcohol prime dose; Approach bias; Attentional bias; Craving; Eye movements","alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; appetite; approach bias; article; association; attention; attentional bias; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire; drinking behavior; eye movement; female; human; image display; male; motivation; parameter; priority journal; questionnaire; stimulus response; task performance; withdrawal syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Appetitive Behavior; Attention; Cues; Culture; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethanol; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome","GO601070, MRC, Medical Research Council","Acknowledgements We would like to thank Elizabeth Tyler and Paul Christiansen for their help during testing, Fren Smulders for his contribution to devising the experimental design, and Gerard van Breukelen for his statistical advice.

Consistent with previous studies, participants showed hypervigilance toward angry faces, as indexed by facilitated response time for validly cued probes following angry faces and an enhanced P1 component. An opposite pattern was found for happy faces suggesting that attention was directed toward the relatively more threatening stimuli within the visual field (neutral faces). Source localization of the P1 effect for angry faces indicated increased activity within the anterior cingulate cortex, possibly reflecting conflict experienced during invalidly cued trials. No modulation of the early C1 component was found for affect or spatial attention. Furthermore, the face-sensitive N170 was not modulated by emotional expression.

In a dot-probe attentional bias paradigm, White participants with low and high external motivation to respond without prejudice toward Blacks (i.e., low-EM and high-EM individuals, respectively) were presented with pairs of White and Black male faces that bore either neutral or happy facial expressions; on each trial, the faces were displayed for either 30 ms or 450 ms. The findings were consistent with those of previous research on threat and attention: High-EM participants revealed an attentional bias toward neutral Black faces presented for 30 ms, but an attentional bias away from neutral Black faces presented for 450 ms. These attentional biases were eliminated, however, when the faces displayed happy expressions. These findings suggest that high levels of external motivation to avoid prejudice result in anxious arousal in response to Black individuals, and that this response affects even basic attentional processes. © 2008 Association for Psychological Science.",,"adult; anxiety; arousal; article; attention; attitude; epidemiology; facial expression; female; human; male; physiology; psychological aspect; social psychology; Adult; Anxiety; Arousal; Attention; Attitude; Bias (Epidemiology); Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Prejudice",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949218388

Nine right-handed participants performed rhythmic pronation and supination movements of the forearm in time with an auditory metronome. A secondary task, consisting of a pedal response to visual probe stimuli, was employed to infer the attentional cost of the coordination task. When the axis-of-rotation (AOR) was placed below the long axis of the forearm, the average time to react (RT) to the probe stimuli was greater for the supinate-on-the-beat condition than for the pronate-on-the-beat condition. Conversely, with the AOR above the forearm, RT for the pronate-on-the-beat pattern was greater than that for the supinate-on-the-beat pattern. Thus, changing the mechanical context of an upper limb coordination task altered the central processing cost required to maintain pattern stability. This finding provides further evidence that the attentional resources required to produce a particular movement are determined by the ease with which the action is executed by the sensorimotor system. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Socially anxious participants completed a probe detection task by identifying letters (E or F) replacing one member of a pair of faces (neutral or disgust). The authors trained attention by including a contingency between the location of the neutral face and the probe in one group (Attention Modification Program; AMP). Participants in the AMP group showed significantly less attention bias to threat after training and lower levels of anxiety in response to a public-speaking challenge than did the participants in the Attention Control Condition (ACC) group.

METHOD: Children completed a visual probe task in which pairs of face stimuli were displayed for 500 milliseconds and were replaced by a visual probe in the spatial location of one of the faces. RESULTS: Severely anxious children with GAD showed an attentional bias toward both angry and happy faces. Children with GAD with a milder level of anxiety and nonanxious controls did not show an attentional bias toward emotional faces. Moreover, within the GAD group, attentional bias for angry faces was associated with increased anxiety severity and the presence of social phobia.

Nonanxious youths (n = 51; ages 9-18 years) were recruited separately. Participants were administered a computerized visual probe task that presents pairs of faces portraying threat (angry), positive (happy), and neutral expressions. They pressed a response key to indicate the spatial location of a probe that replaced one of the faces on each trial. Attention bias scores were calculated from response times to probes for each emotional face type. Results: Compared to healthy youths, anxious participants demonstrated a greater attention bias toward threat faces. This threat bias in anxious patients did not significantly vary across the anxiety disorders. There was no group difference in attention bias toward happy faces.

At least part of the explanation for this may be that theanine, which is present in tea but not coffee, has relaxing effects. There is also some evidence that theanine affects cognitive performance, and it has been found to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Objectives: To study the subjective, behavioural and blood pressure effects of theanine and caffeine administered alone and together, in doses relevant to the daily tea consumption of regular tea drinkers. Materials and methods: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy adult participants (n=48) received either 250-mg caffeine, 200-mg theanine, both or neither of these. They completed ratings of mood, including anxiety, and alertness, and had their blood pressure measured before and starting 40 min after drug administration. Anxiety was also assessed using a visual probe task. Results: Caffeine increased self-rated alertness and jitteriness and blood pressure. Theanine antagonised the effect of caffeine on blood pressure but did not significantly affect jitteriness, alertness or other aspects of mood. Theanine also slowed overall reaction time on the visual probe task. Conclusions: Theanine is a physiologically and behaviourally active compound and, while it is unclear how its effects might explain perceived differences between tea and coffee, evidence suggests that it may be useful for reducing raised blood pressure. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Alertness; Anxiety; Blood pressure; Caffeine; Coffee; Cognition; Mood; Tea; Theanine","amino acid; caffeine; placebo; theanine; unclassified drug; adult; alertness; anxiety; article; behavioral science; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure regulation; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; human; mood; mood change; nervousness; normal human; priority journal; psychologic assessment; psychological rating scale; psychopharmacology; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; self report; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; tea; Adult; Affect; Arousal; Attention; Blood Pressure; Caffeine; Cognition; Discrimination Learning; Double-Blind Method; Facial Expression; Female; Glutamates; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Tea","Mars; Unilever; BBS/B/01855, BBSRC, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Acknowledgement The authors thank Unilever plc for donation of the theanine-containing drinks used in this study and Mars UK for permission to cite the unpublished results on effects of theanine on blood pressure from a previous study.

Although the posture was uninformative it induced attention shifts to the grasp-congruent object within 350ms.

Each trial began with random motion (i.e., dots linearly moved in random directions). After 1 s motion in 1 hemifield became gradually coherent (i.e., all dots moved up-, down-, left-, or rightwards, or either towards or away from a vanishing point). The results show that only looming motion attracted attention, even when the task became a more demanding discrimination task. This effect is not due to an apparent magnification of stimuli presented in the focus of expansion. When the coherent motion started abruptly, all types of motion attracted attention at a short stimulus onset asynchrony. The looming motion effect only disappeared when attention was drawn to the target location by an arrow. These results suggest that looming motion plays a unique role in guiding spatial attention. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","automatic processes; motion perception; random dot motion; visual attention","adult; article; association; attention; depth perception; female; human; male; movement perception; orientation; pattern recognition; perception; perceptive discrimination; psychophysics; visual illusion; Adult; Attention; Cues; Depth Perception; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception; Optical Illusions; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Psychophysics; Size Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349106792

However studies using post-conscious exposure durations have produced contradictory results. The limitations of common attentional tasks, suitability of stimulus materials and differences in stimulus duration times may have contributed to these inconsistencies. We aimed to address many of these issues and examine attentional responses in major depression at two post-conscious exposure times. We also investigated possible roles for rumination and distraction in increasing and lessening attentional biases for negative information. We used a fully controlled experimental design to test the effects of both induced and trait rumination and distraction on attention in patients with major depression and healthy controls. Attention was assessed using the dot-probe task. The findings revealed an attentional bias for negative information in depressed patients only at the longer post-conscious exposure duration. Furthermore although this bias was not influenced by either induced or trait distraction, it was related to trait rumination. Overall, the results showed that depression is associated with a strategic attentional bias towards negative information and that this bias is stronger in individuals who habitually ruminate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were subdivided into those with high and low levels of coping motives for drinking. Results: Compared to a control manipulation, the laboratory stressor task produced increases in alcohol craving (P < 0.01). The laboratory stressor task also produced a significant attentional bias for alcohol-related cues, but only among participants who had high levels of coping motives (P < 0.05).

Cognitive theories associate depression with negative biases in information processing. Although negatively biased cognitions are well documented in depressed patients and to some extent in recovered patients, it remains unclear whether these abnormalities are present before the first depressive episode. Method. High neuroticism (N) is a well-recognized risk factor for depression. The current study therefore compared different aspects of emotional processing in 33 high-N never-depressed and 32 low-N matched volunteers. Awakening salivary cortisol, which is often elevated in severely depressed patients, was measured to explore the neurobiological substrate of neuroticism. Results. High-N volunteers showed increased processing of negative and/or decreased processing of positive information in emotional categorization and memory, facial expression recognition and emotion-potentiated startle (EPS), in the absence of global memory or executive deficits. By contrast, there was no evidence for effects of neuroticism on attentional bias (as measured with the dot-probe task), over-general autobiographical memory, or awakening cortisol levels. Conclusions. These results suggest that certain negative processing biases precede depression rather than arising as a result of depressive experience per se and as such could in part mediate the vulnerability of high-N subjects to depression. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm that such cognitive vulnerabilities predict subsequent depression in individual subjects. © Cambridge University Press 2007.",,"hydrocortisone; arousal; article; attention; autobiographical memory; brain function; clinical article; controlled study; depression; emotion; facial expression; female; human; male; memory; neurosis; risk factor; saliva level; startle reflex; Arousal; Attention; Circadian Rhythm; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Mental Recall; Paired-Associate Learning; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Personality Inventory; Reaction Time; Saliva; Signal Detection (Psychology); Startle Reaction; Students; Verbal Learning",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547843517

The aim of the present study was to confirm and extend this finding by studying the effects of a single dose of oral citalopram on a range of tasks designed to assess different aspects of emotional processing. A total of 32 healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either citalopram 20 mg orally or placebo. Participants then completed a series of tasks assessing emotional aspects of attention (visual-probe task), perception (categorization of facial affect), memory (emotional memory task) and reactivity to threat (emotion potentiated startle). Relative to placebo-treated subjects, participants treated with citalopram demonstrated improved recognition of fearful faces and increased baseline startle response. However, the citalopram group also showed an attentional bias towards positive words. Our data suggest that acute oral citalopram increases the processing of anxiety-related stimuli in healthy volunteers. This mechanism could underlie the known tendency of SSRIs to increase anxiety in patients early in treatment. Our data also suggests that some of the positive biases in emotional processing produced by SSRI treatment might be detectable at the beginning of treatment. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","Attention; Citalopram; Depression; Emotional processing; Memory; Perception; SSRI","citalopram; placebo; adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; facial expression; fear; female; human; human experiment; male; memory; normal human; priority journal; randomization; randomized controlled trial; recognition; side effect; single drug dose; startle reflex; task performance; vision; Administration, Oral; Adult; Attention; Citalopram; Double-Blind Method; Emotions; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Recognition (Psychology); Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Startle Reaction; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547136369

Attentional orientation to drug-related cues may lead to increased craving and preoccupation with the drug and impaired ability to focus attention on nondrug-related activities, resulting in renewed drug taking or relapse from drug abstinence. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether alcohol-dependent inpatients would differ in their selective attention toward alcohol-related stimuli in comparison with a group of social drinking controls. Method: Thirty-five alcohol-dependent inpatients were compared with a group of 39 social drinking controls matched for age, sex, and verbal IQ. Attentional bias was assessed using alcohol-related pictures in a dot probe detection task. Questionnaires were used to examine outcome expectancies after alcohol consumption, anxiety, mood, and craving. Results: The alcoholic inpatients showed a bias away from the alcohol-related stimuli, scored higher on alcohol outcome expectancies, and on anxiety measures (both state and trait). They also presented with more negative mood compared with the control group. Craving was higher in the alcoholic group for the factor ""loss of control over drinking."" Conclusions: Alcoholic inpatients undergoing treatment based on the 12-step treatment of Alcoholics Anonymous (Minnesota model), which includes counseling, and intensive group, individual, and family psychotherapy, show an avoidance for drug-related stimuli and a perception of loss of control over drinking. We suggest that their increased perception of loss of control over drinking produces the avoidance from the drug-related stimuli.

This so-called binocular rivalry results in an alternation of dominant and suppressed percepts. In accordance with current theories of emotion processing, the authors' previous research has suggested that emotionally arousing pictures predominate in this perceptual process. Three experiments were run with pictures of emotional facial expressions that are known to induce emotions while being well controlled in terms of physical characteristics. In Experiment 1, photographs of emotional and neutral facial expressions were presented of the same actor to minimize physical differences. In Experiment 2, schematic emotional expressions were presented to further eliminate low-level differences. In Experiment 3, a probe-detection task was conducted to control for possible response-biases. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that emotional facial expressions predominate over neutral expressions; they are more often the first percept and they are perceived for longer durations. This is not caused by physical stimulus properties or by response-biases. This novel approach supports that emotionally significant visual stimuli are preferentially perceived. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","binocular rivalry; emotional pictures; facial expression; multistable visual perception","adult; arousal; article; binocular vision; controlled study; emotion; facial expression; female; human; male; perception; stimulation; task performance; Adult; Affect; Arousal; Expressed Emotion; Facial Expression; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Reaction Time; Vision, Binocular; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548843377

Objectives: We investigated possible generalisation of attentional training to novel alcohol cues and other methods of measuring cognitive bias. Materials and methods: A modified visual probe task was used to train participants to direct their attention either towards ('attend alcohol' group) or away from ('avoid alcohol' group) alcohol cues; attentional bias was not manipulated in a control group (total N=60). After attentional training, we measured cognitive bias (using visual probe, modified Stroop, flicker-induced change blindness and stimulus-response compatibility tasks), alcohol craving and alcohol consumption. Results: Attentional bias for alcohol cues increased in the 'attend alcohol' group, and this effect generalised to novel stimuli, but not to other cognitive bias tasks. In the 'avoid alcohol' group, attentional bias was reduced for the stimuli that were used during attentional training, but these effects did not generalise to different stimuli or cognitive bias tasks. Alcohol craving increased among participants in the 'attend alcohol' group, but only among participants who were aware of the experimental contingencies during attentional training. There were no group differences in alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The effects of attentional training show limited generalisation to different alcohol cues and methods of measuring cognitive bias. Experimentally increased attentional bias seems to increase subjective craving, but only among participants who are aware of the experimental contingencies that were in place during attentional training. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Attentional bias; Attentional training; Craving; Incentive motivation","adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; analytic method; article; attention; behavior therapy; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; drinking behavior; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; training; Adult; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Attention; Bias (Epidemiology); Cues; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Motivation","RES-000-22-1860, ESRC, Economic and Social Research Council","Acknowledgements This research was funded by a research grant from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), reference RES-000-22-1860, awarded to Matt Field and Theodora Duka.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249887664

The study investigated the effect of negative mood on attentional biases for smoking-related cues and smoking urge in cigarette smokers. Eye movements to smoking-related and control pictures, and manual response times to probes, were recorded during a visual probe task. Smoking urges and mood were assessed by self-report measures. Negative affect was manipulated experimentally as a within-participants independent variable; that is, each participant received negative and neutral mood induction procedures, in counterbalanced order in separate sessions, before the attentional task. There were two groups of participants: smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers showed (i) a greater tendency to shift gaze initially towards smoking-related cues, and (ii) greater urge to smoke when they were in negative mood compared with neutral mood. Manual response time data suggested that smokers showed a greater tendency than nonsmokers to maintain attention on smoking-related cues, irrespective of mood. The results offer partial support for the view that negative mood increases selective attention to drug cues, and urge to smoke, in smokers.

There was also a negative bias against probes on old items that carried the majority color in the preview. With a short preview duration (150 ms) carryover effects to new items were greatly reduced, but probe detection remained biased against the majority color in the old items.

Bipolar patients in a euthymic state (i.e., remission), bipolar patients in a mildly depressed state, and non-psychiatric controls participated. General orienting results showed that within the patient group as a whole, measures of depressed mood were positively associated with a relative inability to disengage attention. Attentional bias results showed that bipolar patients in a mildly depressed state, in comparison with controls, directed their attention away from depression-related words and positive words. The bias away from positive words was equally present in both patient groups and part of a trait effect, demonstrated by the comparison of patients in a euthymic state and controls. The bias away from depression-related words was mood state-dependent and within the patient group as a whole correlated negatively with measures of depressed mood.

To examine plasma formation from conductors impinged upon by ultrahigh magnetic fields, in a geometry similar to that of the MAGO experiments, an experiment is under design to compress magnetic flux in a toroidal cavity, using the Shiva Star or Atlas generator. An initial toroidal bias magnetic field is provided by a current on a central conductor. The central current is generated by diverting a fraction of the liner current using an innovative inductive current divider, thus avoiding the need for an auxiliary power supply. A 50-mm-radius cylindrical aluminum liner implodes along glide planes with velocity of about 5 km/s.

Method: The first study comprised 23 female patients with clinical eating disorders, women with high levels of anxiety (n = 19), and three female normal control groups comprising low (n = 31), moderate (n = 21), or high levels of shape concern (n = 23). The second study comprised 82 women with clinical eating disorders and 44 healthy controls. All participants completed measures of eating disorder psychopathology and completed a modified pictorial dot-probe task. Results: In the first study, biases were found for negative eating and neutral weight pictures, and for positive eating pictures in women with eating disorders; these biases were greater than those found in anxious and normal controls. The second study replicated these findings and biases were also found for negative and neutral shape stimuli.

However, it is unclear whether heavier drinking is associated with higher dietary restraint per se, or restraint combined with a tendency towards disinhibition. The aim of the present study was to examine alcohol use behaviours in women classified using both restraint and disinhibition scores. Forty-four young female social drinkers gave self-reported measures of their drinking behaviour, including frequency and quantity of alcohol consumed and frequency of drunkenness and binge drinking. Attentional bias for alcohol-related stimuli was also assessed using a dot probe detection task. Finally, the Temptation and Restraint Inventory was used to investigate whether preoccupation with drinking might underlie the relationship between dietary and drinking behaviours. Women classified as both highly restrained and disinhibited tended to report more episodes of drunkenness, showed an attentional bias for alcohol-related words, and had greater cognitive preoccupation with drinking compared to other dietary groups. These data suggest that a tendency towards overeating (disinhibition) combined with attempts at restriction is associated with increased alcohol use behaviours, perhaps due to a greater preoccupation with alcohol. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the results, which are traditionally summarized in an attentional bias index, do not allow for distinguishing between different selective attention processes; orienting and disengagement. Second, different versions of the dot probe task have been used with unknown relative merits. Participants (N = 133) completed two versions of the dot probe task: the detection task (i.e. is there a probe?) and the differentiation task (i.e. what sort of probe is it?). The analysis carried out allowed for a differentiation between orienting and disengagement. The main finding was that trait anxiety is related to disengagement difficulties and not to speed of orienting. Concerning the relative merits of the two dot probe task versions, the results suggest that the detection task may be superior to the differentiation task.

Diminishing AB is important because AB has been suggested to be a significant factor in the development, maintenance and relapse of addictive behaviours. AB was trained in a clinically relevant design, and we studied the generalization of this training. Design, participants and intervention: We assigned randomly 106 heavy drinking male college and university students to the attentional re-training (AR; modified visual-probe task) or control condition (standard visual-probe task). Setting: Laboratory at Maastricht University. Measurements: We measured the effects of AR on the visual-probe task with stimuli that were presented in the AR and with new stimuli, and on an alternative measure of AB, the flicker paradigm. We further measured effects on craving and preference for either an alcohol beverage or a soft drink. Findings: After AR, participants had learned to avoid alcohol stimuli and had developed an AB for soft drinks. This effect was restricted to stimuli used in the AR. The flicker task, where AB for alcohol was found in both the AR and control groups, was not affected by the AR. No effect was found on craving and the preference task. Conclusions: Although heavy drinkers can learn to attend selectively to an alternative category for alcohol, a single AR is not sufficient to decrease symptoms of problem drinking. © 2007 The Authors.","Alcohol; Attentional bias; Attentional re-training; Flicker paradigm; Visual-probe","adult; alcohol consumption; article; attention; college student; comparative study; controlled study; human; male; normal human; randomization; task performance; training; university student; visual stimulation; withdrawal syndrome; Adult; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Attention; Awareness; Carbonated Beverages; Choice Behavior; Cues; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Psychotherapy; Students; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846894941

In Study 1, we used a differential implicit learning task (DILT) (see [Schultheiss OC, Pang JS, Torges CM, Wirth MM, Treynor W. Perceived facial expressions of emotion as motivational incentives: evidence from a differential implicit learning paradigm. Emotion 2005;5(1):41-54.]) to investigate the degree to which subjects find anger faces reinforcing. In the DILT, separate sequences of actions were paired with presentations of anger faces, neutral faces or a blank screen. After training, performance on the three sequences was measured in the absence of face stimuli. Saliva was collected for T measurement. Higher T predicted better learning on sequences paired with sub-threshold (i.e., presented too fast for conscious awareness) anger faces, suggesting that T is related to reinforcing qualities of these faces. In Study 2, we examined whether morning or afternoon T better predicted attention and vigilance to anger faces. Participants were tested at 9:00 and 15:00. At each session, saliva was collected for T measurement, and participants completed a Stroop task and a dot-probe task [Mogg K, Bradley BP, Hallowell N. Attentional bias to threat: roles of trait anxiety, stressful events, and awareness. Q J Exp Psychol A 1994;47(4):841-64.] with facial expression stimuli. Morning (peak) T was a better predictor of responses to anger faces than afternoon T. Morning T predicted greater Stroop-like interference to sub-threshold anger faces, as well as attentional orienting away from sub-threshold anger faces. These effects were not present for joy faces or for supraliminal anger faces. T may generally decrease aversion to threatening stimuli, and/or may specifically facilitate approach towards signals of dominance challenge. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Bias towards threat indicates the tendency of an individual to direct attention towards threatening information. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether high test-anxiety in a sample of nonreferred children is associated with attentional bias towards threat pictures, and if low test-anxiety is associated with attentional bias away from threat pictures. A probe-detection task was used with 44 10- to 13-yr.-old children, The overall analyses indicated the presence of an attentional bias away from threatening pictures in these nonreferred children. However, in relation to anxiety, the study did not confirm that high anxious children show an attentional bias towards threatening pictures or that low anxious children show an attentional bias away from threatening pictures. Yet, higher anxiety did seem to be associated with longer mean response times. These longer response times might originate from the interpretation of the nature of a stimulus as too threatening, compared to the actual threatening content, in the first stage of information processing.

To assess hemispheric differences in pun comprehension, visually presented probes that were either highly related (COW), moderately related (LEG), or unrelated, were presented in either the left or right visual half field (LVF/RVF). The sensitivity of each hemisphere to the different meanings evoked by the pun was assessed by ERP relatedness effects with presentation to the LVF and the RVF. In Experiment 1, the inter-stimulus interval between the pun and the onset of the visual probe was 0 ms; in Experiment 2, this value was 500 ms. In Experiment 1, both highly and moderately related probes elicited similar priming effects with RVF presentation. Relative to their unrelated counterparts, related probes elicited less negative ERPs in the N400 interval (300-600 ms post-onset), and more positive ERPs 600-900 ms post-onset, suggesting both meanings of the pun were equally active in the left hemisphere. LVF presentation yielded similar priming effects (less negative N400 and a larger positivity thereafter) for the highly related probes, but no effects for moderately related probes. In Experiment 2, similar N400 priming effects were observed for highly and moderately related probes presented to both visual fields. Compared to unrelated probes 600-900 ms post-onset, related probes elicited a centro-parietal positivity with RVF presentation, but a fronto-polar positivity with LVF presentation. Results suggest that initially, the different meanings evoked by a pun are both active in the left hemisphere, but only the most highly related meaning is active in the right hemisphere. By 500 ms, both meanings are active in both hemispheres. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

To accomplish this, recently published dot-probe data from 36 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and 29 healthy control participants were reanalyzed with consideration of fear of pain (FOP) as a categorical variable. FOP groups were identified by using a variety of strategies and represented differing conceptualizations of the FOP construct. Selective attention for sensory pain, affect pain, and health catastrophe words was assessed by using raw dot-probe detection latencies and the bias, congruency, and incongruency indices. Analysis of the raw detection latencies revealed no significant interactions that permit inferences regarding attentional shifts to or away from specific word types. Analyses of the attention indices revealed no evidence of pain-related selective attention as a function of FOP or the interaction between clinical status and FOP, regardless of the FOP categorization method used; however, for FOP groups derived by using the cluster method, participants with high FOP-all patients-exhibited hypervigilance for all word types on the dot-probe task when compared with those with low FOP. Implications for various categorical conceptualizations of FOP and future research directions are discussed. Perspective: Fear of pain can be used to categorize people into groups more or less vulnerable to disabling effects of pain. When fear of pain groups are derived by using measures of general and pain-specific fearfulness, people with high fear of pain are likely to selectively attend all potentially threatening stimuli in their environment. © 2007 American Pain Society.","Chronic pain; dot- probe; fear of pain; fear-avoidance; hypervigilance; selective attention; taxon","adult; article; chronic pain; clinical article; cluster analysis; controlled study; disability; environment; fear; female; human; latent period; male; musculoskeletal pain; selective attention; task performance; threat; Adult; Attention; Chronic Disease; Cluster Analysis; Cues; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Neuropsychological Tests; Pain; Questionnaires",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845876908

It was hypothesized that thought suppression is causally involved in the emergence of attentional bias. An experiment was conducted with 71 snake-fearful and non-snake-fearful participants to investigate whether instructions for suppression were sufficient to induce an attentional bias toward snake-related words. Thirty-five participants were instructed to suppress all snake-related thoughts, while 36 participants received control instructions. Both groups then completed a 5-min stream of consciousness exercise followed by a dot-probe attention task including snake words, general emotion words, and neutral words. Results indicated that participants instructed to suppress snake-related thoughts exhibited a more pronounced attentional bias toward snake-related word pairs. The same participants did not exhibit an attentional bias toward general emotion or neutral words.

However, there is little research on the component processes of attention in individuals with alcoholism. Here, we examine 2 distinct components of attention in abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals and social drinkers of alcohol, that is to say, the initial orienting to alcohol-related cues, and the maintenance of attention to them. Method: The present study used an ""alcohol"" version of the visual probe detection task with alcohol-related or neutral pictures being presented briefly (i.e., 50 ms), to assess initial orienting, or longer (i.e., 500 and 1,250 ms), to assess the maintenance of attention. Results: Only alcoholic patients were faster in detecting a probe displayed immediately after pictures related to alcohol presented for 50 ms than in detecting the same probe replacing non-alcohol-related pictures. However, when pictures were presented for 500 ms, only social alcohol drinkers were faster in detecting the probe replacing alcohol scenes. At a stimulus of 1,250 ms duration, no group showed attentional bias toward alcohol cues. In addition, the severity of alcoholism measured by the total number of prior detoxification treatments was positively correlated with the attentional bias (or ""attraction"") for alcohol pictures presented for 50 ms. Conclusions: These results show that, subsequent to initial visual orienting to alcohol-related cues, abstinent patients' attention was disengaged from these stimuli, thus suggesting a visual approach-disengagement attentional pattern. The influence of these findings on relapse was discussed.

Selective attention to threat-related information has been associated with clinical delusions in schizophrenia and nonclinical delusional ideation in healthy individuals. However, it is unclear whether biased attention for threat reflects early engagement effects on selective attention, or later difficulties in disengaging attention from perceived threat. The present study examined which of these processes operate in nonclinical delusion-prone individuals. Methods. A total of 100 psychologically healthy participants completed the Peters et al. (1999) Delusions Inventory (PDI). Twenty-two scoring in the upper quartile (high-PDI group) and 22 scoring in the lower quartile (low-PDI group) completed a modified dot-probe task. Participants detected dot-probes appearing 200, 500, or 1250 ms after an angry-neutral face pair or a happy-neutral face pair. Results. High-PDI individuals responded faster to dot-probes presented in the same location as angry compared to happy faces at the short 200 ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), but only when the emotional faces were presented to the left visual field. At the two longer SOAs (500 ms, 1250 ms), the high-PDI group were also faster to respond to dot-probes presented in the same location as angry compared to happy faces and slower to respond to dot-probes presented in different spatial locations to angry (vs. happy) faces. The latter effects were seen whether emotional faces were presented to the left or the right visual field. Conclusions. Results support the operation of emotion-selective engagement and defective disengagement for threat-related facial expressions (i.e., anger) in delusion-prone individuals. © 2006 Psychology Press.",,"adult; anger; article; controlled study; delusion; disease predisposition; emotion; facial expression; female; happiness; human; human experiment; male; mental health; normal human; priority journal; rating scale; selective attention; stimulus response; task performance; threat; visual field; Adult; Agnosia; Color Perception; Female; Humans; Intelligence; Knowledge; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychomotor Performance; Recognition (Psychology); Schizophrenic Psychology; Semantics; Space Perception; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847117198

This study used a hallmark measure of attention bias, the dot-probe task, to determine whether attention bias to sleep-related stimuli is present in individuals with PI. Control groups of good sleepers (GS) and individuals with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), a sleep disorder with no presumed cognitive pathway and, hence, no predicted association with attention bias, were included. Design: A between-groups (PI, DSPS, GS) design was employed. Participants completed a dot-probe task with stimuli comprising sleep-related and neutral words, balanced for length and frequency of usage. It was predicted a priori that PI would show greater attention bias to sleep stimuli compared with GS and DSPS groups. No difference between GS and DSPS was predicted. Participants: Sixty-three individuals completed the study (PI = 21; DSPS = 22; GS = 20), with those in PI and DSPS classified by International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria according to self-report sleep diaries and actigraphy. GS scored < 5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, reported being good sleepers, and met no criteria for a current or previous sleep disorder. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: As predicted, PI showed increased vigilance for sleep-related stimuli relative to GS and DSPS. No differences between GS and those with DSPS were found. The PI group showed shorter response latencies relative to the GS and DSPS groups. Conclusions: Results support an association between attention bias and PI. Further work must determine whether or not attention bias is a causal factor. Speeded responses in the PI group suggest heightened arousal, indicating that physiologic factors may play a related role.","Attention bias; Circadian; Cognitive arousal; Delayed sleep phase syndrome; Insomnia","adult; arousal; article; attention; cognition; delayed sleep phase syndrome; disease classification; dot probe task; female; human; insomnia; international cooperation; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; risk factor; self report; sleep pattern; sleep therapy; stimulus response; task performance",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751119894

Indeed, studies examining relations between eating disorders and attention to body and/or shape related stimuli have found such associations. Although this research is invaluable in characterizing relations between attentional processes and eating disordered attitudes, such work remains correlational in nature. In the present investigation, 73 undergraduate women were randomly assigned to one of two attentional training conditions. One condition trained attention away from body/shape words, whereas the other trained attention toward body/shape words. Following this training participants reported on their eating-related attitudes. Women trained to avoid body/shape words subsequently reported more concerns about eating and body shape. These results suggest that attentional avoidance of body/shape concerns increases such concerns. The results point to the potential causal effects of attention on eating disordered attitudes, in turn suggesting a basis for possible treatment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to uncover the brain machinery underlying the reflexive prioritization of spatial attention to locations of threat-related stimuli. Here, we review functional brain imaging experiments using event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a dot-probe paradigm with emotional face cues, in which we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of attentional orienting to a visual target when the latter is preceded by either a fearful or happy face, at the same (valid) location or at a different (invalid) location in visual periphery. ERP results indicate that fearful faces can bias spatial attention toward threat-related location, and enhance the amplitude of the early exogenous visual P1 activity generated within the extrastriate cortex in response to a target following a valid rather than invalid fearful face. Furthermore, this gain control mechanism in extrastriate cortex (at 130-150 ms) is preceded by an earlier modulation of activity in posterior parietal regions (at 40-80 ms) that may provide a critical source of top-down signals on visual cortex. Happy faces produced no modulation of ERPs in extrastriate and parietal cortex. fMRI data also show increased responses in the occipital visual cortex for valid relative to invalid targets following fearful faces, but in addition reveal significant decreases in intraparietal cortex and increases in orbitofrontal cortex when targets are preceded by an invalid fearful face, suggesting that negative emotional stimuli may not only draw but also hold spatial attention more strongly than neutral or positive stimuli. These data confirm that threat may act as a powerful exogenous cue and trigger reflexive shifts in spatial attention toward its location, through a rapid temporal sequence of neural events in parietal and temporo-occipital areas, with dissociable neural substrates for engagement benefits in attention affecting activity in extrastriate occipital areas and increased disengagement costs affecting intraparietal cortex. These brain-imaging results reveal how emotional signals related to threat can play an important role in modulating spatial attention to afford flexible perception and action. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

One reason for this discrepancy may be that researchers using the dot-probe task have rarely investigated any effects which might emerge earlier than 500 ms following presentation of the threat-related faces. Accordingly, in the current study we presented pairs of face stimuli with emotional and neutral expressions and probed the allocation of attention to these stimuli for presentation times of 100 and 500 ms. Results showed that at 100 ms there was an attentional bias towards the location of the relatively threatening stimulus (the angry face in angry/neutral pairs and the neutral face in neutral/happy pairs) and this pattern reversed by 500 ms. Comparisons of reaction time (RT) scores with an appropriate baseline suggested that the early bias toward threatening faces may actually arise through inhibition of the relatively least threatening member of a face pair rather than through facilitation of, or vigilance towards, the more threatening stimulus. However the mechanisms governing the observed biases are interpreted, these data provide evidence that probing for the location of spatial attention at 500 ms is not necessarily indicative of the initial allocation of attention between competing emotional facial stimuli. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One possibility, based on cognitive models of anxiety, is that fear information creates attentional biases similar to those seen in anxiety disorders. Children between 7 and 9 years old were given positive information about 1 novel animal, negative information about another, and no information about the 3rd. A pictorial dot-probe task was used, immediately or with a 24-hr delay, to test for attentional biases to the different animals. The results replicated the finding that fear information changes children's fear beliefs. Regardless of whether there was a delay, children acquired an attentional bias in the left visual field toward the animal about which they held negative beliefs compared to the control animal. These results imply a possible way in which fear information might contribute to acquired fear.

To investigate this claim, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants covertly prepared a left or right response, as indicated by a precue presented at the beginning of each trial. Cues signalled a left or right eye movement in the saccade task, and a left or right manual response in the manual task. The cued response had to be executed or withheld following the presentation of a Go/Nogo stimulus. Although there were systematic differences between ERPs triggered during covert manual and saccade preparation, lateralised ERP components sensitive to the direction of a cued response were very similar for both tasks, and also similar to the components previously found during cued shifts of endogenous spatial attention. This is consistent with the claim that the control of attention and of covert response preparation are closely linked. N1 components triggered by task-irrelevant visual probes presented during the covert response preparation interval were enhanced when these probes were presented close to cued response hand in the manual task, and at the saccade target location in the saccade task. This demonstrates that both manual and saccade preparation result in spatially specific modulations of visual processing, in line with the predictions of the premotor theory. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We used event-related fMRI to determine how brain responses to a neutral visual target are influenced by the emotional expression of faces appearing at the same location during a covert orienting task. On each trial, two faces were briefly presented, one in each upper visual field (one neutral and one emotional, fearful or happy), followed by a unilateral target (a small horizontal or vertical bar) replacing one of the faces. Participants had to discriminate the target orientation, shown on the same (valid) or opposite (invalid) side as the emotional face. Trials with faces but no subsequent target (cue-only trials) were included to disentangle activation due to emotional cues from their effects on target detection. We found increased responses in bilateral temporo-parietal areas and right occipito-parietal cortex for fearful faces relative to happy faces, unrelated to the subsequent target and cueing validity. More critically, we found a selective modulation of intraparietal and orbitofrontal cortex for targets following an invalid fearful face, as well as an increased visual response in right lateral occipital cortex for targets following a valid fearful face. No such effects were observed with happy faces. These results demonstrate that fearful faces can act as exogenous cues by increasing sensory processing in extrastriate cortex for a subsequent target presented at the same location, but also produce a cost in disengaging towards another location by altering the response of IPS to invalidly cued targets. Neural mechanisms responsible for orienting attention towards emotional vs. non-emotional stimuli are thus partly shared in parietal and visual areas, but also partly distinct. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Visual response cues instructed participants to prepare to lift their left or right index finger in response to a subsequent target stimulus. Irrelevant visual or auditory probes were delivered to the left or right hand during the response preparation interval. ERPs were measured time-locked to cue onset, and time-locked to probe stimulus onset. Results: Lateralised ERP components triggered during covert response preparation (ADAN, LDAP) were similar to components previously found during attention shifts. N1 components were enhanced to visual probes delivered adjacent to the cued response relative to those delivered to the opposite hand. Auditory probe ERPs were unaffected by manual response preparation. Conclusions: Shifts of spatial attention that are triggered during covert unimanual response preparation result in spatially specific modulations of visual but not auditory processing. Significance: Results support the claim of the premotor theory that the preparation of manual responses is associated with attention shifts.

In the present study, event-related potentials were recorded to examine whether pain patients show performance decrements on attentional processing capacity tasks due to shared resources by pain and attention or, alternatively, due to deficits in allocating attentional resources during pain. Fourteen chronic pain patients and thirty age and education matched healthy controls were investigated. An attentional capacity probe task was used in which the difficulty level was manipulated, resulting in an easy and a difficult condition, while task-irrelevant visual probes were presented. These probe-elicited P3 amplitudes were assumed to provide the most pure estimate of processing capacity since they are relatively free from target-related processes. Event-related potentials were recorded from the midline electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz. For the behavioral measures, it was found that pain patients maintained a different speed-accuracy tradeoff. Pain patients showed faster reaction time responses and higher error rates compared to controls. No significant differences were found between pain patients and controls on the primary task. Pain patients differed from controls with respect to amplitudes elicited by task-irrelevant probe stimuli. For healthy controls, the expected decreased amplitude was found for probe stimuli in the difficult compared to the easy task. In contrast, the pain patients did not show decreased probe amplitudes with increasing task load. The data may imply that allocation of attentional resources is deficient in pain patients, instead of attentional capacity. © 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

During the past few years, research has demonstrated that implicit cognitions predict unique variance in prospective alcohol use and preliminary results indicate that they also predict treatment outcomes. The central question in this symposium was how implicit cognitions can be changed and how the changes will influence behavior. Field presented data showing that an attentional bias for alcohol can be altered by attentional training: heavy drinkers who were trained not to attend to alcohol stimuli reported less craving and drank less beer than those trained to attend to alcohol stimuli. Schoenmakers used a similar, clinically relevant attentional retraining (AR) procedure, heavy drinkers were trained not to attend to alcohol pictures or received no training. After the training, the AR group attended less to the alcohol pictures than the control group. Fadardi described the Alcohol Attentional Control Training Program (AACTP), which makes alcohol drinkers aware of the automatic, cognitive determinants of their drinking and aims to help them to gain control over these processes. Data were presented to support the effectiveness of the AACTP. Palfai presented data showing that alcohol drinkers can be taught to use implementation intentions to gain control over their drinking, which may be used to automatically activate self-control skills in the presence of alcohol cues. In his discussion, Stacy pointed out the importance of recent cognitive theories that integrate attention and memory processes - theories that can help us better understand the mechanisms involved in AR. Together, the studies presented demonstrate that there are promising new ways in which implicit alcohol-related cognitions and their effects on drinking can be changed. After further refinement, these procedures might be used in clinical interventions that have not previously addressed implicit cognitive processes.

Nominal change in auditory comprehension and untrained attention and memory functions was observed, and neither RW nor his spouse reported noticeable improvements in his daily attention or communication abilities. These and previous findings indicate that structured attention retraining may enhance specific attention skills, but that positive changes in broader attention and untrained functions are less likely. As a result of reading this article, the participant will be able to: (1) summarize the previous literature regarding attention impairments and treatment approaches for patients with aphasia. (2) describe how Attention Processing Training-II affected the attention, auditory comprehension, and other cognitive abilities of the patient in this study. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives: Changes due to amitriptyline treatment on attentional processing capacity were investigated on behavioral measures and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in six patients with neuropathic pain. Materials and methods: Patients were treated for 15 consecutive days with 25 mg nocturnally administered amitriptyline or placebo in a double-blind crossover randomized design. Measurements were carried out on day 1 and day 15 of each treatment period. An attentional capacity probe task was used in which the difficulty level was manipulated, resulting in an easy and a hard condition, while task-irrelevant visual probes were presented. During task performance, ERPs were measured from the midline electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz. Results: Amitriptyline increased reaction times (RTs) after acute but not after subchronic administration. ERP analyses showed that P3 amplitudes to the task stimuli were not affected by amitriptyline in either treatment phase. Moreover, P3 amplitudes to the probes were increased in the easy compared to the hard task condition after subchronic amitriptyline treatment, indicating beneficial effects of repeated amitriptyline administration. In contrast, acute amitriptyline administration did reduce an earlier visual evoked potential, N1, preceding the P3 component. Conclusions: The results suggest that amitriptyline, even at low dosages of 25 mg, affects performance after acute administration in chronic neuropathic pain patients. After 2 weeks of treatment, performance appears to be unaffected.

Firstly, to investigate the effect of increasing threat-expectancy on attentional biases towards pain-related words. Secondly, to determine the interaction between threat-expectancy and the effectiveness of two coping strategies on pain threshold and tolerance. Thirdly, to investigate the relationship between fear of pain and the experimental manipulations. One hundred undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-increasing or reassuring information about the cold pressor task. After reading the information, all participants completed the dot-probe task for four categories of pain-related words. Following the dot-probe task, participants were randomly allocated to one of two coping strategy conditions (focusing on affective vs sensory aspects of pain). Participants then completed the cold pressor task while engaging in the relevant coping strategy. There was a significant effect of threat on bias towards affective vs sensory pain words. Participants in the threat condition showed a stronger bias towards affective pain words. In contrast, the no-threat condition displayed a stronger bias towards sensory pain words. Significant interaction effects were observed between threat and coping strategy for threshold and tolerance. These results indicated that focusing on sensory pain sensations was helpful in the absence of threat, however, in the presence of threat was relatively unhelpful in comparison to focusing on the affective components of pain.

Visual search benefits when observers are given a preview of distractors that remain throughout a subsequent search display. Studies examining negative carry-over effects and visual probe detection suggest that the 'preview benefit' is based at least in part on the inhibition of old groups of stimuli. However, the presence of luminance onsets defining the new search display are not necessary to produce the benefit, since, under appropriate conditions, a benefit can occur when the new stimuli do not have unique luminance onsets. Studies using functional brain imaging suggest that the inhibition of old groups of stimuli is modulated by the superior parietal lobe, whereas the detection of salient new targets is associated with activation in the temporo-parietal junction. Dynamic inhibition of memory representations of old stimuli provides a means of prioritizing attention to new events. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Tokyo.","functional brain imaging; preview paradigm; Visual search",,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892215335

Recent work has also found evidence for an attentional bias in habitual caffeine users. It remains unclear whether deprivation state can influence attentional bias. Here we explored the relationship between caffeine deprivation, attentional bias to caffeine-related stimuli and subsequent caffeine reinforcement measured by consumption of coffee. In three experiments, participants (between-subjects: n=28; within-subjects: n=20, wfthin-subjects: n=20) were preloaded with either caffeine (experiments 1 and 3:100 mg; experiment 2:150 mg) or placebo, and in experiments 1 and 2 they completed a novel attentional bias task involving preattentive word recognition, and in experiment 3 a dot-probe task In experiments 2 and 3, this was followed by a test of coffee consumption. Greater recognition for caffeine-related words (experiments 1 and 2) and faster reaction times to probes replacing caffeine-related rather than control stimuli (experiment 3) confirmed caffeine-related attentional biases, but in no case was this affected by manipulation of caffeine-deprivation state. Participants in a deprived versus nondeprived state, however, experienced increases in drowsiness and headaches (experiment 2) and reduced alertness (experiment 3). Further, coffee consumption was greatest when participants were caffeine-deprived than when they were nondeprived.

The present study therefore examined this issue in terms of differences in attentional bias for caffeine-related words in High, Moderate and Non-caffeine consumers using a dot-probe word task following overnight caffeine abstinence. Objectives: This study was conducted to test whether caffeine consumers show an attentional bias for caffeine-related words, and whether such biases relate to habitual levels of caffeine use. Methods: Sixteen High, Moderate and Non-consumers of caffeine were asked to complete a modified dot-probe task in order to measure attentional bias for caffeine-related relative to neutral control word groups. The task was completed following overnight caffeine abstinence, and participants also completed mood and caffeine-craving measures. Results: The High consumer group showed a significant attentional bias for the caffeine-related words, but no such bias was seen in Moderate or Non-consumer groups. As expected, craving for caffeine was strongest in the High consumers and weakest in the Non-consumers. Attentional bias in the High group correlated with self-reported caffeine consumption and with craving for caffeine, but neither effect was significant in the Moderate group.

Methods: We monitored the eye movements of 41 smokers (predominantly young adults, who smoked from one to 40 cigarettes per day) as they completed a visual probe task in which smoking-related and matched control pictures were presented. Participants also completed a stimulus-response compatibility task, which measured the tendency to approach smoking-related cues, and a rating task. Results: Smokers with lower levels of nicotine dependence showed greater maintained attention and faster approach responses to smoking-related cues.

The group of trauma victims improved clinically over time. Predictors of the number of PTSD symptoms after 3 months were re-experiencing (33% of the variance) and amplitude of the evoked HR reaction to trauma-related pictures (15%). The two variables were highly correlated.

Experiment 2 was a Stroop task, and Experiment 3 was a dot-probe task, also using threat and non-threat words as targets. Across all three experiments, worriers exhibited lower cognitive bias during positive imagery compared to during worry, whereas non-worriers did not show a difference in memory or response latency for all three experiments. A fourth experiment was conducted to determine whether there was a differential rate of catastrophic thinking or positive imagery in association with worry level.

A related aim of this study was to introduce the application of multilevel analysis to test the influence of personal relevance on selective attentional processing in this sample. Patients completed the modified Stroop task, as well as a set of self-report measures aimed to assess Fear of Pain, Trait Anxiety, Catastrophizing, Pain Vigilance, and Pain Intensity. The modified Stroop task comprised 33 sensory pain-related words for which the personal relevance towards current concerns was rated afterwards by each participant on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The multilevel analyses did not support the hypothesis that personal relevance of sensory pain-related words interacted with Fear of Pain scores of patients in accounting for reaction times in naming the color of sensory pain-related words. None of the other self-report measures accounted for reaction times in isolation or in interaction with personal relevance. The modified Stroop task does not appear to be a robust measure of selective attentional processing in patients with chronic low back pain.

Objectives: We examined whether alcohol would increase attentional, approach, and evaluative biases for smoking-related cues in a sample of daily cigarette smokers. Methods: The study used a visual probe task with eye movement recording to investigate biases in visual orienting to smoking-related cues. A stimulus-response compatibility task was used to assess approach tendencies for smoking-related cues, and an explicit rating task was used to assess the perceived valence of smoking-related cues. Participants completed the tasks in two sessions, once after consumption of 0.4 g/kg alcohol and once after consumption of a non-alcoholic drink. Results: Alcohol increased the maintenance of attention on smoking cues (evident from gaze duration and a reaction time index of attentional bias), the perceived pleasantness of smoking cues, and cigarette craving, relative to the non-alcoholic drink. However, alcohol had no effect on the initial shifting of gaze to smoking cues or on the tendency to approach smoking cues. Conclusions: These results suggest that, in smokers, ingestion of a moderate dose of alcohol increases the propensity for smoking-related cues to hold attention and makes those cues seem more attractive, which is consistent with alcohol increasing the 'incentive salience' of smoking cues. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Alcohol; Attentional bias; Craving; Drug cues; Evaluative bias; Smoking","alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; article; association; attention; cigarette smoking; cognition; concentration response; controlled study; eye movement; gaze; human; human experiment; male; priority journal; response time; smoking; stimulus response; task performance; vision; visual stimulation; withdrawal syndrome; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Beverages; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Cues; Eye Movements; Humans; Motivation; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Smoking","Wellcome Trust","Acknowledgements This work was supported by a University of Southampton Faculty Research Support Fund awarded to Matt Field.

To study attention bias in children, the authors used picture-based versions of the visual-probe attention bias task previously used with adults.

Method: A visual-probe task that manipulated threat levels was used to test 34 children who had been maltreated and 21 children who had not been maltreated. The visual-probe task involved showing photographs of actors with faces depicting neutral, angry/threatening, or happy expressions for 500 msec each. Results: Attention bias away from threat was associated with severity of physical abuse and diagnosis of PTSD. This association reflected the tendency for high levels of abuse or PTSD to predict attention avoidance of threatening faces.

By contrast, in clinical depression, the evidence for an attentional bias is less robust, despite depressive disorder being commonly associated with high levels of co-morbid anxiety.

The present investigation was an attempt to replicate and extend initial findings obtained with the dot-probe task. Thirty patients with chronic headache and 19 healthy controls were tested using a dot-probe task including affect pain, sensory pain, and neutral words. Individual difference variables, including fear of pain measures, were assessed and considered in analyses. Selective attention was denoted using the bias index, congruency index, and incongruency index. There were no significant between-group differences or interactions between group and word type observed for any of the indices of selective attention. Across groups there was evidence for a significant association between anxiety sensitivity and the bias index for sensory pain words, and between affective description of current pain and the incongruency index for affect pain words. These results do not provide convincing evidence that patients with chronic headache selectively attend to affect or sensory pain cues when compared to healthy controls.

Ninety-one participants who were selected to form extreme groups based on a social anxiety screening measure performed a dot-probe task to assess location of attention.

Moreover, recent cognitive theories have proposed that an attentional bias for objectively threatening stimuli may be common to all individuals, with this effect enhanced in anxious individuals. The current study investigated whether an attentional bias toward fear-related pictures could be found in nonselected children (n = 105) and adults (n = 47) and whether a sample of clinically anxious children (n = 23) displayed an attentional bias for fear-related pictures over and above that expected for nonselected children. Participants completed a dot-probe task that employed fear-related, neutral, and pleasant pictures. As expected, both adults and children showed a stronger attentional bias toward fear-related pictures than toward pleasant pictures.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether attentional bias towards alcohol-related stimuli would increase after priming with either one of two doses of alcohol (0.3 or 0.6 g/kg) or placebo. Methods: Questionnaires were used to measure alcohol use, mood states, craving for alcohol and alcohol outcome expectancies. Attentional bias was assessed using a dot-probe detection task and a modified Stroop task. Results: Mood ratings showed dose dependent increases in positive mood after the alcohol pre-load. In the dot-probe task, all subjects showed an attentional bias towards the alcohol-related stimuli over neutral stationery-related items, although the attentional bias was significantly positive only at the low alcohol dose. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the attentional bias under the high alcohol dose and the alcohol use questionnaire score. In the Stroop task, a dose related effect of alcohol was found, with subjects making more errors for alcohol-related words under the high alcohol dose. Conclusions: These data support ideas derived from the incentive learning theories of drug addiction.

The study aimed to investigate attentional bias and both implicit and explicit memory biases for personally salient and standardised emotional stimuli in persecutory delusions and depression. Sampling: 36 participants, with 12 in each group, were interviewed in order to generate personally salient stimuli to be employed within the cognitive tests. Standardised emotional stimuli were additionally employed as a control. Participants completed two probe detection tasks, one including personally salient stimuli and one including standard emotional stimuli. Memory for the stimuli presented in this task was assessed by a free recall task (explicit memory) followed by a word completion task (implicit memory). Results: On an implicit memory task, both the deluded and depressed groups displayed comparable retrieval of positive and negative words. However, on the explicit memory task, the depressed group demonstrated a bias for negative stimuli, whereas the deluded group demonstrated a bias for positive stimuli. The groups did not demonstrate an attentional bias for personally salient information. However, an attentional bias for standardised emotional stimuli was found in the depressed group, although this was not specifi c to either negative or positive stimuli. Conclusion: The results indicate that depression and persecutory delusions may share similar patterns of processing at an implicit level but differentiate at the explicit level, which may be indicative of cognitive avoidance of threatening stimuli in psychosis. However, this does not seem to be a feature of automatic attentional processes in people with persecutory delusions. Implications for further research are discussed. Copyright © 2004 S.

In this study, 44 undergraduates performed a pictorial version of the probe detection task. Taking into account the reaction times on neutral trials, we found no evidence for a facilitated detection of threatening information.

In Study 1 those with high social anxiety displayed an attentional bias towards negative faces. The low social anxiety group showed an attentional bias towards positive faces. No significant effects were observed on the dot probe using words as stimuli. Study 2 used pairs of faces presented in profile as though looking at each other. One of the faces displayed either a positive, negative or neutral expression. The second face always had a neutral expression, and in half of the trials it was the subject's own face.

Deprivation also increased craving and pleasantness ratings of smoking cues. Across both deprived and non-deprived conditions, smokers were more likely to shift their gaze towards smoking cues and were faster to respond to probes replacing smoking cues, relative to non-smoking cues, but these attentional bias measures were not significantly affected by the deprivation manipulation. Conclusions: Results suggest a selective effect of deprivation on the maintenance of attention on smoking-related cues.","Attentional bias; Drug cues; Eye movements; Nicotine deprivation; Smoking","nicotine; adult; article; attention; cigarette smoking; clinical article; controlled study; eye movement; female; gaze; human; male; measurement; priority journal; statistical significance; withdrawal syndrome; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Behavior, Addictive; Cues; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Nicotine; Photic Stimulation; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Smoking; Smoking Cessation","Wellcome Trust; 057076, Wellcome Trust","Acknowledgements This work was supported by a grant from the Wellcome Trust to Brendan Bradley and Karin Mogg (ref. 057076).

To date research has focused upon nonforensic samples, and trait and state levels of anger. If individuals who are habitually aggressive demonstrate processing bias then it is likely that other constructs such as aggressiveness, hostility, and impulsivity will also be correlated with any bias performance. We attempted to extend the research by also considering the role of aggressive experience and impulsivity in such bias by using a group of offenders (n = 50) from prisons in the North of England and undergraduates (n = 30) from a university in the North of England. We hypothesised that violent offenders (as classified by their index offence) would demonstrate delayed responses when presented with aggressive stimuli as targets in a thematically primed version of the traditional dot-probe task, due to the activation of associated representational structures by a violently themed vignette when compared to a neutral vignette. We also hypothesised that the violent offenders would become distracted when searching for a neutral word target which was surrounded by aggressive words in a visual search task [Cohen et al., 1998] leading to delayed responses compared to a neutral word surrounded by negatively or positively themed emotion words. Finally, we hypothesised that undergraduates with elevated levels of aggressiveness would also show similar (albeit attenuated) biases for these materials. Violent offenders demonstrated significant response biases to aggression words in both tests. This effect was also found in the aggressive undergraduates (as classified by their scores on the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire). These data confirm the saliency of aggression words to aggressive individuals across populations. The objective nature of these tests, together with their resilience to deception, may offer a useful tool in the assessment and treatment of aggressive individuals ©2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Aggression; Anger; Attentional bias; Impulsivity; Offenders",,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442692751

Method: Colour cues were paired with negatively (i.e., imposition of delay) and positively valenced cues (i.e., escape from or avoidance of delay) during a conditioning phase. These cues were presented alongside neutral cues in a subsequent dot-probe detection phase. Results: In experiment 1 teacher-identified children with AD/HD (N = 12), but not controls (N = 12), displayed an attentional bias towards both positively and negatively valenced cues. In experiment 2 children with a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder (N = 15), but not controls (N = 15), displayed a bias towards delay-related cues. However, this effect was largely carried by the response to positively valenced cues. Conclusions: These results confirm the dot-probe conditioning paradigm as a useful test of motivational influence on attention. They provide the first evidence of qualitative differences in the attentional style of children with AD/HD and give further support to those theories that highlight the motivational significance of delay in AD/HD. © Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2004.","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Attentional bias; Delay aversion; Dot-probe paradigm","article; association; attention deficit disorder; clinical article; conditioning; controlled study; female; human; hyperkinesia; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; rating scale; school child; scoring system; statistical analysis; statistical significance; task performance; visual stimulation; Attention; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Conditioning (Psychology); Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Reaction Time; Time Management",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242329202

University students (n = 63, 75% Caucasian) completed a ""dot probe"" computer task that presented supraliminal (conscious) and subliminal (below conscious awareness) social threat words. Order of task presentation (supraliminal vs. subliminal) was randomly determined. Results found that for those completing the supraliminal task first, attentional avoidance of supraliminal threat words was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, negative current mood, and an avoidant coping style. In contrast, bias towards subliminal threat words was associated with depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, avoidant coping and negative mood, and less primary control coping. However, few relationships among supraliminal or subliminal bias and coping or affect were evident when participants completed the subliminal task first. Findings suggest that when primed by consciously available cues, strategic coping processes may influence attentional biases at both supraliminal and subliminal levels of presentation. Clinical interventions aimed at improving cognitive coping skills may benefit treatment of affective disorders partially through influences on information-processing characteristics.","Anxiety; Attentional bias; Coping; Depression","adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; article; attention; consciousness; controlled study; coping behavior; depression; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; male; mood disorder; perceptive threshold; symptom; threat",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-3342970486

We also obtained explicit and implicit measures of the valence of the smoking-related pictures from pleasantness ratings and from behavioural responses on a stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task. Results showed that smokers, but not non-smokers, had an attentional bias for smoking-related pictures which had been presented at two exposure durations (200 and 2000 ms). The bias was not found in a brief (17 ms) masked exposure condition, so there was no evidence that it operated preconsciously.

The performance of drug users on the Stroop task and visual dot-probe task has been interpreted as demonstrating attentional bias toward drug cues specific to an individual's drug use history. However, studies often fail to include necessary control groups or comparison stimuli, thereby making it difficult to definitively conclude that reported results reflect a specific attentional response to personally relevant drug events.

Earlier we reported that keeping track of the identity of targets (as measured by recall of their previously assigned labels) tended to be poorer that keeping track of their status as targets, and that ID errors tended to increase more rapidly with trial length. We provided evidence that this was likely due to the fact that targets tended to be more frequently confused with other targets than with nontargets. A possible reason for this asymmetry is that nontargets might be actively inhibited in MOT, thus resulting in their being less readily confused with targets. In the present study we investigated this hypothesis using the dot-probe method first adopted by (Watson & Humphreys, 1997). Observers viewed an MOT display during which they had to detect the brief appearance of a small spot that occurred on 50% of the trials at one of 3 location types: on a target, a nontarget, or somewhere in between. At the end of each trial, observers selected the targets using a mouse, and then indicated whether or not there had been a probe during that trial. We found that accuracy for detecting a probe was significantly worse when the probe was on a nontarget. No other pairwise contrast was statistically reliable. Tracking performance also appeared to be the same for all probe locations as well as for the no-probe condition. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nontargets are inhibited during MOT, thus accounting for the asymmetry between target-nontarget and target-target confusions. They are also consistent with the hypothesis that MOT does not consume the same visual-attention resources as monitoring a visual event. These results are discussed in relation to the FINST Visual Indexing Hypothesis.",,"accuracy; analytical error; article; controlled study; eye tracking; human; human experiment; hypothesis; randomization; reliability; selective attention; statistical analysis; visual discrimination; visual information; visual stimulation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-4243082175

There is evidence that measures derived from experimental cognitive psychology yield important information about cue reactivity. We used a pictorial version of the visual probe task to evaluate: (i) whether minimally deprived smokers attend differentially to smoking cues (attentional bias); (ii) whether this bias is related to self-reported craving and dependence; and (iii) whether it predicted outcome in a subsequent cessation attempt. Design Participants took part in a structured smoking cessation program. Each participant completed the visual probe task roughly 2 weeks before quitting while non-deprived. Setting: A research smoking cessation clinic. Participants: 141 heavy smokers seeking treatment for smoking cessation. Measurements: The computerized attentional bias measure and self-reported urge were taken in a laboratory session. Participants also monitored their smoking and craving on electronic diaries both when smoking ad libitum and for up to 6 weeks post-cessation. Findings: Participants were faster and more accurate in responding to a visual probe that replaced a smoking picture than to a neutral picture, indicating that they showed attentional bias towards the smoking cues. Attentional bias on the first half of the task correlated with pre-task craving, indicating that the bias may tap motivational processes, but it did not predict outcome in smoking cessation. Conclusions: The visual probe task can add useful information about attentional responses to drug cues. Further work is required to uncover the theoretical significance and utility of this measure.","Attentional bias; Craving; Cue reactivity; Smoking cues","nicotine; adult; article; attention; cigarette smoking; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug dependence; electronics; female; health program; human; laboratory; major clinical study; male; motivation; outcomes research; patient monitoring; prediction; randomized controlled trial; self report; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; withdrawal syndrome; Adult; Attention; Cues; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nicotine; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Use Disorder; Treatment Outcome",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142061672

Patients with social phobia (n=28), patients with social phobia and a concurrent depressive disorder (n=33), and non-patients (n=40) were presented with word pairs each consisting of a neutral word and a threat word. The results indicated that patients with social phobia show an attentional bias towards social-threat words while non-patients tend to avoid social-threat words. Patients with social phobia and a concurrent depressive disorder behaved like non-patients, indicating that concurrent depression abolishes the attentional bias. Physical threat words were also included in the study. The main analysis indicated that social phobia is also associated with an attentional bias to physical threat. However, a post hoc analysis (which requires replication) suggested that the physical threat bias might have arisen because some social phobia patients also had another anxiety disorder in which physical concerns are likely to have been prominent. Overall, the results emphasise the importance of assessing comorbidity when investigating attentional biases. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Objectives: To support this theory, we assessed whether a stimulus that had acquired control of a tobacco-seeking response in a discrimination procedure would command the focus of visual attention in a subsequent test phase. Methods: Smokers received discrimination training in which an instrumental key-press response was followed by tobacco-smoke reinforcement when one visual discriminative stimulus (S+) was present, but not when another stimulus (S-) was present. The skin conductance response to the S+ and S- assessed whether Pavlovian conditioning to the S+ had taken place. In a subsequent test phase, the S+ and S- were presented in the dot-probe task and the allocation of the focus of visual attention to these stimuli was measured. Results: Participants learned to perform the instrumental tobacco-seeking response selectively in the presence of the S+ relative to the S-, and showed a greater skin conductance response to the S+ than the S-. In the subsequent test phase, participants allocated the focus of visual attention to the S+ in preference to the S-. Correlation analysis revealed that the visual attentional bias for the S+ was positively associated with the number of times the S+ had been paired with tobacco-smoke in training, the skin conductance response to the S+ and with subjective craving to smoke. Furthermore, increased exposure to tobacco-smoke in the natural environment was associated with reduced discrimination learning. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that discriminative stimuli that signal that tobacco-smoke reinforcement is available acquire the capacity to command selective attentional and elicit instrumental tobacco-seeking behaviour.","Cue-reactivity; Incentive; Salience; Smoking","tobacco smoke; article; attention; cigarette smoking; female; human; human experiment; male; priority journal; sex difference; skin conductance; task performance; tobacco; visual discrimination; visual stimulation; Adult; Attention; Breath Tests; Conditioning, Operant; Cues; Discrimination Learning; Female; Galvanic Skin Response; Humans; Male; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; Tobacco Use Disorder","061162, Wellcome Trust","Acknowledgement This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Research Grant no. 061162.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043240399

Here, we investigated whether electrical cortical responses to an independent central visual probe stimulus change as a function of whether optical flow stimulation in the periphery induces the illusion of self-motion or not. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were obtained in response to pattern-reversals in the central visual field in the presence of a constant peripheral large-field optokinetic stimulus that rotated around the naso-occipital axis and induced intermittent sensations of vection. As control, VEPs were also recorded during a stationary peripheral stimulus and showed no difference than those obtained during optokinetic stimulation. The VEPs during constant peripheral stimulation were then divided into two groups according to the time spans where the subjects reported object- or self-motion, respectively. The N70 VEP component showed a significant amplitude reduction when, due to the peripheral stimulus, subjects experienced self-motion compared to when the peripheral stimulus was perceived as object-motion. This finding supplements and corroborates our recent evidence from functional neuroimaging that early visual cortex deactivates when a visual flow stimulus elicits the illusion of self-motion compared with when the same sensory input is interpreted as object-motion. This dampened responsiveness might reflect a redistribution of sensorial and attentional resources when the monitoring of self-motion relies on a sustained and veridical processing of optic flow and may be compromised by other sources of visual input.",,"adult; article; attention; brain cortex; brain depth stimulation; evoked visual response; female; human; human experiment; illusion; male; movement perception; nerve stimulation; normal human; optokinetic stimulation; priority journal; psychophysics; self motion; sensory stimulation; vection; visual field; visual stimulation; Adult; Electrophysiology; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Illusions; Male; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Proprioception; Visual Cortex; Visual Fields; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042316831

Design: Smokers and non-smokers took part in a single session in which their attentional and evaluative responses to smoking-related and matched control pictures were recorded. Participants: Twenty smokers and 25 non-smokers. Measurements: Direction and duration of gaze was measured while participants completed a visual probe task. Subjective and cognitive-experimental measures of the motivational and affective valence of the stimuli were recorded. Findings: Smokers, but not non-smokers, maintained their gaze for longer on smoking-related pictures than control pictures. They were also faster to detect probes that replaced smoking-related than control pictures, consistent with an attentional bias for smoking-related cues. Furthermore, smokers showed greater preferences for smoking-related than control pictures, compared with non-smokers, on both the subjective (explicit) and cognitive-experimental (implicit) indices of stimulus valence. Within smokers, longer initial fixations of gaze on smoking-related pictures were associated with a bias to rate the smoking pictures more positively, with greater approach tendencies for smoking pictures on the cognitive-experimental task, and with a greater urge to smoke. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that smokers show biased attentional orientating to smoking cues, which is related to craving and the affective and motivational valence of the stimuli.","Attentional bias; Drug cues; Eye movements; Smoking; Stimulus valence","adult; affect; article; association; attention; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; eye movement; female; gaze; human; male; motivation; smoking; stimulus response; stimulus valence; visual aid; visual orientation; visual stimulation; Adult; Attention; Cues; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Photic Stimulation; Photography; Reaction Time; Smoking",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038510009

A probe detection task that aimed to measure the balance of attention between internal and external stimuli was developed. High and low socially anxious individuals were instructed to detect two probes.

We sought evidence for this proposal by measuring visual attentional orienting towards smoking pictures presented briefly in the periphery of the visual field, versus control pictures likewise presented, in smokers versus non-smokers. In each trial, smokers and non-smokers responded manually to a dot probe stimulus that appeared in a location previously occupied by either a smoking picture or a control picture. Attentional bias scores were calculated by subtracting the median reaction time (RT) in the former condition from the median RT in the latter condition. In two experiments, light-smokers (smokers of fewer than 20 cigarettes/day) produced a mean bias score that was significantly greater than that of heavy-smokers (smokers of 20 or more cigarettes/day) and non-smokers. In addition, when smokers from the two experiments were pooled, a significant quadratic relationship was found between cigarettes/day and the attentional bias for the smoking stimuli.

We, therefore, conducted a study with unmasked (conscious) and masked (preconscious) versions of the visual dot-probe task, and examined the effect of pain fearfulness on performance. In the masked trials, we confirmed that individuals with a low fear of pain seem to orient away from pain-related material. Furthermore, we also found that when stimuli were masked, this bias was reversed. Neither effect was found amongst participants high in the fear of pain.

It has been suggested that fear of pain and/or anxiety sensitivity predispose individuals to chronicity. According to this view, pain is maintained through hypervigilance towards painful sensations and subsequent avoidance. The present study investigates the nature of cognitive biases in chronic pain patients. A sample of 169 consecutive patients referred to a specialist pain management centre participated in the study. Questionnaires measuring different aspects of pain and a computerised version of the Dot-Probe Task were administered. Four types of words related to different dimensions of pain and matched, neutral words were used as stimuli. Reaction times in response to the stimuli were recorded. A factorial design 3 x 4 x 2 x 2 and ANOVAs were employed to analyse the data. Chronic pain patients showed a cognitive bias to sensory pain words relative to affective, disability, and threat-related words. However, contrary to expectations, those high in fear of pain responded more slowly to stimuli than those less fearful of pain. These results suggest that patients with chronic pain problems selectively attend to sensory aspects of pain. However, selective attention appears to depend upon the nature of pain stimuli. For those who are highly fearful of pain they may not only selectively attend to pain-related information but have difficulty disengaging from that stimuli. Theoretical and clinical implications of the data are discussed. © 2003 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Results indicated that high anxious individuals were faster to respond to probes occurring in the spatial location of masked threat rather than neutral faces; consistent with their attention being automatically captured by sub-threshold threat cues. Furthermore, this vigilance effect for masked threat faces appeared to be primarily a function of social anxiety and social avoidance, rather than trait anxiety. It was also more apparent when threat faces were presented in the left visual field, suggestive of right hemisphere involvement. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Research has demonstrated that readers do not comprehend metaphoric reference as easily as they do literal reference (Gibbs, 1990; Onishi & Murphy, 1993). In two experiments, we used a naming version of the cross-modal lexical priming (CMLP) paradigm to monitor the time-course of comprehending spoken metaphoric reference. In Experiment 1, listeners responded to visual probe words of either a figurative or literal nature that were presented at offset or 1000 ms after a critical prime word. Significant facilitatory priming was observed at prime offset to probes consistent with the metaphorical interpretation of the figuratively referring description, yet no priming was found for either probe type at the downstream location. In Experiment 2, we partially replicated Experiment 1 results at prime offset and found no priming at a probe point placed 1000 ms upstream from prime onset. Taken together, the data from these two experiments indicate that listeners are able to comprehend metaphoric reference faster than literal reference. Moreover, the effect appears to be strongest at prime offset, suggesting that activation of the nonliteral interpretation is closely tied to the relationship between the figuratively referring description and the intended referent. Implications for theories of metaphor comprehension, as well as for research in spoken metaphor, are discussed. © 2002 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.","Cross-modal lexical priming; Figurative language; Metaphor; Metaphor comprehension; Reference metaphor; Spoken language comprehension","adult; article; attention; concept formation; female; human; linguistics; literature; male; problem solving; semantics; speech perception; Adult; Attention; Concept Formation; Female; Humans; Male; Metaphor; Problem Solving; Psycholinguistics; Semantics; Speech Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036365409

This bias appears to diminish following successful treatment. Two studies examined whether current cigarette smokers show biased attention toward smoking-related images compared with non-smokers (Studies 1 and 2) and whether this bias is less pronounced in former smokers (Study 2). Attentional bias toward cigarette-related photographs was examined using the dot-probe task. Pairs of images (one smoking-related) appeared side by side for 500 ms on a computer screen prior to the presentation of a probe (an asterisk) replacing one of the photographs. Subjects struck a key as quickly as possible to indicate the probe location. Attentional bias was defined as faster reaction times when the probe replaced the smoking-related image. In both studies, current smokers displayed significantly greater attentional bias toward cigarette stimuli than did non-smokers. Former smokers in Study 2 displayed an intermediate level of bias, but did not differ significantly in bias score from either of the other groups. These results support further use of the dot-probe task as a measure of attentional bias in non-abstinent smokers and in individuals undergoing smoking cessation treatment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Method: Subjects were 56 female first-year undergraduate psychology students, aged 17-24 years, participating for course credit. High and low scorers on the Drive for Thinness and Body Dissatisfaction subscales of the EDI-2 completed alternative modified dot probe tasks containing food words, body shape/weight words, and control words, under fasted and nonfasted conditions. Results: Fasting increased attentional bias toward high-calorie food words across all subjects. High EDI-2 scorers also showed an attentional bias toward low-calorie words, but only when nonfasted. Discussion: Food-related attentional biases, commonly observed in eating disorder patients, may reflect a pervasive concern with food-related stimuli as opposed to being simply a product of chronic hunger. That is, with increasing hunger, high EDI-2 scorers shift their focus away from low-calorie foods to high-calorie foods.

In particular, this paper focuses upon current attempts to extend an information processing framework traditionally associated with childhood psychopathology (i.e., Crick & Dodge [Psychol Bull 115 (1994) 74]) and anxiety-related attentional bias research previously conducted only with adults, to populations of anxious children. First, a thorough discussion of Crick and Dodge's model and its applicability to current theories of anxiety is presented. Although each stage of Crick and Dodge's model is shown to possess correlates with current conceptualizations of anxiety, the research investigations reviewed here focus upon the multiple approaches that have been undertaken to better comprehend anxious children's attentional biases in encoding and subsequent task performance decrements. Specifically, recent investigations of anxious children's attentional performance utilizing Stroop tasks, probe detection tasks, and the relatively new probe localization task are reviewed. A discussion of the disparate findings associated with recent studies of each of these tasks is given, with an eye toward the need to specify the developmental, theoretical, demographic, and clinically relevant characteristics associated with the biased attentional behavior observed among highly anxious children. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A key feature of the present study is that it used three different measures of processing bias for linguistic and pictorial smoking-related cues: masked and unmasked conditions of the modified Stroop task, and a pictorial version of the visual probe task. Participants were smokers (n = 27), who were tested twice, with deprivation level manipulated as a within-subjects variable. They were asked to abstain from smoking for 12 h before one session, and to smoke normally before the other. Results were consistent with an attentional bias for smoking-related pictures on the visual probe task, and for smoking-related words in the unmasked condition of the modified Stroop task. The latter bias was most strongly predicted by self-reported urge to smoke, rather than by the deprivation manipulation. There was no evidence of a preconscious bias for smoking cues. The three measures of cognitive bias (from masked and unmasked Stroop and visual probe tasks) were not significantly correlated with each other, which suggests they may tap different underlying mechanisms.

However, the parietal cortex also seems to play a role in motivation and emotion. In the present study the lateralized role of the parietal cortex in motivated attention was investigated, using an electrophysiological correlate of brain activity (electroencephalogram (EEG)) and a modified Dot probe task, which indexes selective, i.e. avoidant or vigilant attention for angry faces in a spatial display. Twenty-two participants underwent an EEG baseline recording from the F3, F4, P3 and P4 electrode positions, which was followed by the modified Dot probe task. Spectral power in 1 Hz frequency bins were derived for each electrode site and transformed to power density values in the 8-12 Hz (alpha) and 13-30 Hz (beta) frequency range. Log-transformed prefrontal and parietal asymmetries and bias scores for selective attention to angry and happy faces were calculated. Results showed a highly significant relationship between the asymmetry in parietal EEG beta activity and the attentional response to the angry face. Relative more right-sided parietal EEG activity in the beta frequency domain was predictive of a more avoidant response to angry facial expression. This finding suggests that asymmetrical parietal beta activity might be linked to the behavioural dimensions of approach and withdrawal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether non-dependent heavy social drinkers would differ in their selective attention towards alcohol-related stimuli in comparison with a group of occasional social drinkers. Methods: Attentional bias was assessed using alcohol-related pictures and words in a dot probe detection task. Picture and word pairs were visually presented, followed by a dot probe that replaced one of the items. Attentional bias was determined from latencies in responding to the dot probe. Questionnaires were used to examine the relationships among attention, outcome expectancies after alcohol consumption, and personality traits. Higher-order executive function was also measured with two cognitive tasks, recognition memory and attentional shift. Results: The heavy social drinkers showed an attentional bias towards the alcohol-related stimuli when compared to the occasional social drinkers. The heavy social drinkers also scored more highly on expectancy factors of sociability and sexuality and lower on the personality traits of self-directedness and persistence. Conclusion: The results support cognitive theories of addictive behaviour in which the ability of drug-related stimuli to capture attention is suggested to play a part in drug dependence, craving and relapse.","Alcohol expectancy; CANTAB; Emotional bias; Executive function","alcohol consumption; anxiety; article; attention; cognition; drinking behavior; emotion; human; latent period; memory consolidation; personality; priority journal; sexuality; social interaction; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Attention; Cognition; Cues; Ethanol; Female; Humans; Male; Psychological Tests","G9806260, MRC, Medical Research Council","Acknowledgements This work was supported by an MRC programme grant No G9806260.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034879341

One reason why such fears exist may be because those high in anxiety sensitivity selectively attend towards such sensations. However, few studies have actually investigated these cognitive biases in high anxiety sensitive individuals. The current study, therefore, sought to investigate selective attentional biases using the visual dot-probe paradigm. Since recent research suggests that at least one component of anxiety sensitivity is linked to the fear of physical sensations, individual were selected on the basis as to whether they were high or low in their anxious concern for physical sensations. In order to determine whether a general or specific attentional bias exists, the emotionality of material presented to participants was varied in terms of whether it was physically threat-related, socially threat-related, or positive. Consistent with predictions, those high in physical anxiety sensitivity were found to exhibit a selective attentional bias in favour of the location of physically threatening material. Furthermore, those low in anxiety sensitivity were found to avoid such material. Interestingly, a similar attentional bias was not found for either socially threatening or positive material. If anything, those high in physical anxiety sensitivity avoided positive material. These findings are discussed in light of current theories of anxiety sensitivity and future research. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Anxiety sensitivity; Cognitive biases; Hypervigilance; Information processing; Selective attention","adult; alertness; anxiety; article; cognition; computer analysis; controlled study; decision making; disease predisposition; emotionality; female; human; human experiment; information processing; male; normal human; physical sensitivity; psychometry; selective attention; statistical analysis; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Psychological Tests; Sensation",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034963040

However, when just the search-critical object parts were removed or when participants received immediate error feedback to prevent rechecking of the search objects, IOR effects were observed only when probes appeared equally likely at search array and empty locations.

Results from the colour-naming task suggested that high levels of defensiveness (in combination with low trait anxiety) were associated with greater avoidance of threat. The REP group showed less interference in colour-naming threat than neutral words; whereas the HA group showed increased interference due to threat words. On the dot probe task, there was a general tendency for this non-clinical sample as a whole to show avoidance of social threat relative to neutral words, but there was no bias for physical threat words. Avoidance of social threat was significant only within the REP group. No relationships were found between the measures of cognitive bias from the two tasks, suggesting different underlying mechanisms.

During the letter task, male subjects identified more probes from the left hemifield than from the right. Their accuracy varied little across the two hemifields during the dots task.Experiment 2 tested whether this pattern is due to either spatial attention or interference in character processing. Instead of identifying digits, the probe task required subjects to respond to a black square that appeared in the periphery of the screen. For male subjects, the pattern was opposite of that from Experiment 1. During the letter task they responded faster to the probe in the right hemifield than in the left. Their response times were equivalent across the two hemifields during the dots task.These results indicate two separate effects of laterality in male subjects. The activation of one hemisphere produced more attention to the contralateral hemifield in Experiment 2, and the letter memory task interfered with the processing of other characters in the right visual field more than those in the left visual field in Experiment 1. Neither of these effects appeared in female subjects, corroborating earlier claims that female brains are less lateralized than male brains.

In a number of theories of compulsive drug use conditioned responses to stimuli associated with drug taking play a pivotal role. For example, according to incentive-sensitization theory, drug-related stimuli selectively capture attention, and the neural mechanisms underlying this attentional bias play a key role in the development and maintenance of drug dependence, and in relapse. However, there has been little work that assesses attentional biases in addiction. Methods. We used a pictorial probe detection task to investigate whether there is an attentional bias to stimuli associated with drug use in opiate dependence. Stimuli presented included pairs of drug-related and matched neutral pictures. Methadone-maintained opiate addicts (N = 16) were compared with age-matched controls (N = 16). Results. A mixed design analysis of variance of response times to probes revealed a significant three-way interaction of group x drug picture location x probe location. Opiate addicts had relatively faster reaction times to probes that replaced drug pictures rather than neutral pictures, consistent with the predicted attentional bias to drug-related stimuli. Conclusions. These results support the idea that an attentional bias for drug-related stimuli occurs in opiate dependence. This is consistent with the concept of a central role for such salient stimuli in compulsive drug use.",,"adult; article; association; attention; clinical article; compulsion; controlled study; female; human; image display; male; methadone treatment; normal human; opiate addiction; statistical analysis; Adult; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Narcotics; Opioid-Related Disorders; Visual Perception",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033965287

MacLeod's visual attention (or dot probe) paradigm (MacLeod et al., 1986) was used, as well as a word recognition task. Food, weight/shape and neutral words were presented. Fifty-nine women, classified as restrained or unrestrained eaters, participated in both tasks. The visual attention task revealed neither attention nor avoidance of food and weight/shape stimuli. In the recognition task, however, restrained subjects were found to need less time for recognizing food words than neutral words. For unrestrained eaters, the response times for food and neutral words were the same. The results in this study, may be explained by Wegner's Ironic Process Theory (Wegner, 1994). Wegner argues that, in order to avoid certain thought contents, an individual needs to attend to those contents. For the restrained eater this might mean that she first shifts attention towards the food words in the dot probe task in order to subsequently avoid them, which might explain the zero net effect. Indirect support for the idea that restrained eaters needed to attend the food words in order to avoid them, is found in the results of the recognition task: restrained subjects needed less time to recognize food stimuli than neutral stimuli.

The RT data indicated enhanced vigilance for threat rather than neutral faces in high and medium, but not low, state anxiety. The bias for negative faces appeared to be a combined function of stimulus threat value and the individual's anxiety level. The RT bias did not seem to depend on overt orienting, as many participants made few EMs. However, those who made frequent EMs to the faces showed concordance between the RT and EM bias measures, and so the RT measure of attentional bias for negative versus positive faces at 500 ms appears to provide a valid index of the direction of initial orienting to emotional stimuli. There was no evidence of an anxiety-related bias for happy faces (predicted by the emotionality hypothesis), nor a dysphoria-related bias for sad faces.

However, according to a 'cognitive-motivational' view, trait anxiety influences the appraisal of stimulus threat value, rather than the direction of attentional bias, and both high and low trait anxious individuals should exhibit greater vigilance for high rather than mild threat stimuli (Mogg and Bradley, 1998). To test these predictions, two experiments examined the effect of manipulating stimulus threat value on the direction of attentional bias. The stimuli included high threat and mild threat pictorial scenes presented in a probe detection task. Results from both studies indicated a significant main effect of stimulus threat value on attentional bias, as there was increased vigilance or reduced avoidance of threat, as threat value increased.

The timing of sentence context effects have important theoretical implications for models of language processing (e.g., initial context independence vs. initial interaction). Yet, different tasks tend to yield different results. For both experiments, stimuli from an acoustically manipulated ""goat-to-coat "" continuum were embedded in sentences whose interpretation was biased toward either ""goat"" or ""coat."" In experiment 1 (CMI), the primary task was listening to sentences for comprehension; the interference task was a word/nonword decision to an unrelated visual probe that appeared at one of three positions within the sentence. Results showed immediate effects of the acoustic manipulation, but only delayed effects of sentence context. These results were interpreted to indicate that phonological processing is initially context-independent but is followed by rapid context integration. Experiment 2 used a word-monitoring task: Response times were significantly longer when sentence context was incongruent with the monitoring target, showing an immediate effect of context. The apparently contradictory results of the two experiments together support an account of language processing in which phoneme categorization is initially independent of sentence context unless an explicit judgment about the identity of the target is required. © 2000 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,"adult; article; human; phonetics; physiology; randomization; reaction time; speech; speech perception; Adult; Humans; Phonetics; Random Allocation; Reaction Time; Speech; Speech Acoustics; Speech Perception","DC00494, NIH, National Institutes of Health; MH42900, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NIMH Grant MH42900 and NIH Grant DC00494.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034145562

Recent cognitive theories propose that attentional biases cause or maintain anxiety disorders. This study had several aims: (i) to investigate such biases in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using naturalistic, ecologically valid stimuli, namely, emotional facial expressions; (ii) to test the emotionality hypothesis by examining biases for happy as well as threat faces; and (iii) to assess the time course of the attentional bias. Design. The dependent variable was an index of attentional bias derived from manual RTs to probe stimuli. There were four independent variables: one between-subjects variable of group (2: GAD, control), and three within-subjects variables: Type of emotional face (2: threat, happy), Stimulus duration (2: 500 ms, 1250 ms) and Half of task (2: first, second). Method. Attentional bias was assessed with a dot probe task. The stimuli comprised photographs of threatening, happy and neutral faces, presented using two exposure durations: 500 ms and 1250 ms. Results. Anxious patients showed greater vigilance for threatening faces relative to neutral faces, compared with normal controls. This effect did not significantly vary as a function of stimulus duration. Anxious patients also showed enhanced vigilance for happy faces, but this was only significant in the second half of the task. Conclusions. The study confirmed not only that GAD patients show a bias in selective attention to threat, relative to controls, but also that this bias operates for naturalistic, non-verbal stimuli. As the attentional biases for threat and happy faces appeared to develop over a different time frame, different underlying mechanisms may be responsible.",,"adult; alertness; anxiety neurosis; article; clinical article; cognition; emotionality; face; female; human; male; photography; priority journal; selective attention; stimulus; threat; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Chi-Square Distribution; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032868695

The present study used a pictorial version of the probe detection task to examine attentional biases for emotional facial expressions. The main aims were (1) to see if our previous finding of greater vigilance for threatening faces in high than low trait anxiety could be replicated [Bradley, B. P., Mogg, K., Falla, S. J., and Hamilton, L. R. (1998). Attentional bias for threatening facial expressions in anxiety: manipulation of stimulus duration. Cognition and Emotion, in press] and (2) to examine whether the same pattern of results and a similar effect size, would be obtained using a 'probe position' task (i.e. where is the probe?), rather than the 'probe classification' task (i.e. what is the type of the probe?) used by Bradley et al. (1998). The probe position task produced similar results to those obtained from the probe classification task, so providing further evidence of an anxiety-related attentional bias for threatening faces. Results also indicated that, for non-clinical participants, the probe position task yielded faster overall RTs, fewer errors and a similar effect size, compared with the probe classification task. Implications for the assessment of attentional biases in non-clinical and clinical samples are discussed.

A modified Stroop task and a visual probe task (VPT) were used, with physical threat words, social threat words, social positive words and general positive words. The relationship of the response to the two tasks was also investigated. The results showed that high state anxiety was related to greater Stroop interference of physical threat words as well as social words, both threat and positive. No group effects were found for the Stroop, in spite of sufficient power. In contrast, in the VPT high trait anxious subjects shifted attention only towards social threat words, especially when these words were presented outside their attentional focus. No difference involving the repressor group was present. There was a small positive inter-task relation for social threat-related bias. It is suggested that the emotional biases measured by the Stroop and the VPT reflect automatic decisions about cognitive resource allocation at subsequent phases in information processing, at which increasingly more specific aspects of the emotional information are deciphered and used. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using a classical dual-task methodology, we demonstrated that the time taken to react to an unpredictable visual probe stimulus (the secondary task) by means of a pedal response was greater when the extension phase of the finger movement sequence was made on the beat of the metronome than when the flexion phase was coordinated with the beat. In a second experiment, the posture of the wrist was manipulated in order to alter the operating lengths of muscles that flex and extend the index finger. The attentional demands of maintaining the extend-on-the-beat pattern of coordination were altered in a systematic fashion by changes in wrist posture, even though the effector used to respond to the visual probe stimulus was unaffected.","Attentional demands; Coordination; Movement; Posture","article; attention; auditory stimulation; body posture; controlled study; human; human experiment; index finger; normal human; priority journal; reaction time; visual stimulation; voluntary movement; wrist",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038947538

One of the most fruitful lines of research in this area is the study of selective attention in persons suffering from an emotional disorder. Several paradigms have been employed to examine this attentional bias (e.g. dichotic listening, Emotional Stroop, visual dot-probe task) and to demonstrate how task performance is facilitated or inhibited due to the presentation of a stimulus that is related to the emotional concerns of the participants. A problem associated with these paradigms is that they only measure attention deployment at a very specific moment immediately after the presentation of the emotional stimulus, but are not suitable for capturing the course of selective attention over longer time periods. In a study with spider anxious participants, we used on-line registration of eye movements as a continuous index of attention deployment towards emotionally relevant (spiders) or irrelevant (flowers) material. Viewing patterns were registered during a 3-second presentation of stimuli composed of a picture of a spider and a picture of a flower. Results show that spider anxious participants looked significantly more at spiders than at flowers during the beginning of the stimulus presentation, but subsequently their viewing pattern shifted more and more away from the spiders. Control participants showed a more stable pattern as they looked more at spiders than at flowers throughout the trial. A traditional attentional bias effect could, however, not be replicated. © 1999 Psychology Press Ltd.",,,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000125318

The current study was conducted in an attempt to replicate and extend this finding. Nineteen patients with chronic pain stemming from musculoskeletal injury and 22 healthy control subjects participated. All participants completed a computerised task designed to evaluate attentional allocation to cues thematically related to pain and injury via measurement of detection latencies for dot-probes that followed their presentation. Results indicated that patients did not differ from control subjects in their pattern of responses to dot-probes that were presented following either the pain- or injury-related cues. This pattern of results continued to hold true after including level of depression as a covariate in the analysis. However, when patients were divided on the basis of scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Peterson, R.A. and Reiss, S., Anxiety Sensitivity Index Manual, 2nd edn., International Diagnostic Systems, Worthington, OH, 1992), a measure related to fear of pain (Asmundson, G.J.G. and Norton, G.R., Behav. Res. Ther., 34 (1996) 545-554), those with low anxiety sensitivity shifted attention away from stimuli related to pain whereas those with high anxiety sensitivity responded similarly to dot- probes regardless of the parameters of presentation. These results suggest that the operation of the information processing system in patients with chronic pain may be dependent on a patient's trait predisposition to fear pain. Theoretical and ecological implications are discussed.","Anxiety sensitivity; Chronic pain; Dot-probe paradigm; Fear of pain; Selective attention","adult; anxiety; article; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; fear; female; health promotion; human; male; musculoskeletal injury; patient attitude; priority journal; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Disease; Cues; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal System; Pain",,"Preparation of this manuscript was supported, in part, by a grant to the first author from the Saskatchewan Health Services Utilization and Research Commission.

Word pairs were presented on a computer screen for 100, 500 or 1500 msec, and immediately after the termination of the display of each pair, a dot probe appeared in the position of one of the words. Higher levels of state anxiety were associated with faster response latencies for probes that replaced threat words, rather than neutral words (i.e. attentional vigilance for threat). This bias was not significantly affected by the exposure duration of the word stimuli. Thus, the attentional bias for threat does not appear to vary significantly over this range (100-1500 msec) in non-clinical anxiety; it is recommended that the time course of the attentional bias be investigated further in clinical anxiety.",,"adult; anxiety; article; controlled study; exposure; female; hospital service; human; male; normal human; stimulus response; threat",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030893953

Study 1 utilized a self-referent endorsement task to obtain a set of empirically validated stimulus adjectives related to each maladjustment domain for use in the attentional paradigm in Study 2. Moreover, Study 1 provided some initial support for content-specificity proposals at the self-schema level. Self-descriptive ratings in Study 1 indicated that depressed individuals uniquely identified themselves with adjectives relating to hopelessness, loss, and failure. In contrast, the unique self-descriptive adjectives of anxious individuals centered on themes of social threat. Bulimics, in turn, endorsed unique self-descriptors relating to food and weight issues, whereas Type A self-descriptions were uniquely associated with achievement concerns. Content-specificity effects for selective attention were obtained in Study 2 for three of the four domains of interest (i.e. depression, anxiety, and bulimia). Using a modified probe-detection task, and very stringent criteria for group classification, it was found that individuals in each of these three groups selectively attended to personal adjectives that were hypothesized to be of specific relevance to their underlying cognitive concerns. Limited content-specificity effects were obtained for an incidental recognition measure, with only the depressed and bulimic groups showing enhanced memory performance for personal adjectives uniquely related to their dominant self-views.

To evaluate the role of awareness, half the word stimuli were presented very briefly (14 msec) and masked, and the other half were presented for 500 msec without a mask. Results showed that high trait anxious subjects under exam stress showed an attentional bias towards unmasked threat stimuli compared with low trait subjects. This effect was not found under lab-induced stress, suggesting that the attentional bias for unmasked threat in high trait subjects may be a function of a prolonged stressor, rather than a transient increase in state anxiety.

The main focus of the simulation was to determine the feed locations that would provide a maximum acceleration without exceeding operational limits of the barrel containment. A secondary focus of the simulation was to make railgun performance predictions that could be used to set attenuation values for railgun b-dot probes. A generalized set of equations was derived, that closely resembles the breech-fed configuration equations, due to the multiple current loops associated with the multiple power supply configuration. The generalized multiple power supply equations are a set of vector equations with a simple mathematical form that allow for an infinite number of power supplies. This technique provides flexibility for theoretical configurations. The simulation code was tested against experimental results from the breech fed configuration of the Thunderbolt railgun.

It is concluded that depression is not associated with a bias to show greater selective attention to stimuli threatening self esteem. © 1989.",,,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011991775

All experiments employed 33 tone‐light or light‐tone (S1‐S2) pairings, and for experimental groups, S2 was omitted on 4 trials, experiment 1 (N = 24) demonstrated reliable electrodermal responding when S2 was omitted for a trial, and subsequent dishabituation when S2 was then re‐presented after SI on the immediately following trial. Experiment 1 (N=96) employed probe RT as the dependent variable. White noise probe stimuli were presented 300 ms or 1300 ms following the omission of S2 and following its onset on re‐presentation trials. Reaction time to probes presented during S2 omission was slower in experimental groups than in control groups. Reaction time on S2 re‐presentation trials was also slower in experimental groups than in control groups, but only when S3 was a tone. Experiment 3 (N=48) employed auditory and visual probes presented 1300 ms following S2 omission and S2 re‐presentation, and measured both electrodermal activity and probe RT, Some evidence of electrodermal omission responding and dishabituation was obtained. Reaction time was again slowed during the omission and re‐presentation of S2. regardless of the modality of S2 and regardless of the modality of the probe. The results are interpreted as consistent with an information‐processing approach to orienting and habituation in that they indicate that both the omission and re‐presentation of an expected stimulus command processing resources.

However, the available data can be accommodated by alternative explanations, including response bias accounts. The current study introduces a novel paradigm that circumvents such interpretative problems by requiring subjects to make a neutral response (button press) to a neutral stimulus (visual dot probe). The position of this dot probe was manipulted on a VDU (visual display unit) screen relative to visually displayed words, which could either be threat related or neutral in content. Probe detection latency data were then used to determine the impact of threat-related stimuli on the distribution of visual attention. Clinically anxious (but not clinically depressed) subjects consistently shifted attention toward threat words, resulting in reduced detection latencies for probes appearing in the vicinity of such stimuli. Normal control subjects, on the other hand, tended to shift attention away from such material. The results were interpreted as supporting the existence of anxiety-related encoding bias, and it is suggested that this cognitive mechanism may contribute to the maintenance of such mood disorders. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"adult; affective neurosis; anxiety; attention; central nervous system; clinical article; cognition; human; human experiment; psychological aspect; Adult; Affective Symptoms; Anxiety Disorders; Arousal; Attention; Depressive Disorder; Human; Set (Psychology); Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022898410

Parallel experiments on adults and infants presented acoustic and visual probes unpredictably while subjects attended to acoustic and visual foregrounds: Attention was indexed by heart rate deceleration. When probe and foreground modality matched, probe-elicited reflex blinks were significantly facilitated in magnitude (infants) or latency (adults) relative to reflexes elicited when probe and foreground modality mismatched. Further, facilitation was greater when modality-matching probes were presented over foregrounds judged a priori to be more 'interesting' than 'dull' foregrounds. Because acoustic and visual blink reflexes have a common efferent path, modulating effects must have occurred earlier, in modality-specific paths. As such, the results suggest that attention can influence 'automatic' sensory-perceptual analysis. © 1985.",,"adult; age; attention; autonomic nervous system; child; eyelid reflex; heart; heart rate; human; human experiment; normal human; peripheral nervous system; priority journal; psychological aspect; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Attention; Auditory Perception; Blinking; Female; Heart Rate; Human; Infant; Male; Physical Stimulation; Reaction Time; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Visual Perception","UW, University of Wisconsin-Madison; HD03352, Core; K3-MH21762, NIH, National Institutes of Health; HD01490, NIH, National Institutes of Health; MH40199, NIH, National Institutes of Health","* This research was supported by NIH grants HD01490 and MH40199, by a Research Scientist award K3-MH21762 and Hilldale Research Professorship to FKG, and by a core support grant HD03352 to the Waisman Center on Mental Retardation and Human Development. **Send reprint requests to: Bruno J.

Specific features of the ERPs were affected in amplitude and latency by the experimental variables: group membership, oral vs. silent reading, difficulty level, and recording site (within and between hemispheres). A specific effect of difficulty on the central and parietal ERP was seen in the dyslexics but not the controls. Different patterns of asymmetry were found for the two groups in silent vs. oral reading at midtemporal placements.

Subjects participated in a series of studies in which they were required to perform a target acquisition task while also covertly counting either auditory or visual probes. The effects of several task-difficulty manipulations on the P300 component of the ERP elicited by the counted stimulus probes were investigated. With sufficiently practiced subjects the amplitude of the P300 was found to decrease with increases in task difficulty. The second experiment also provided evidence that the P300 is selectively sensitive to task-relevant attributes. A third experiment demonstrated a convergence in the amplitude of the P300s elicited in the simple and difficult version of the tracking task. The amplitude of the P300 was also found to covary with the measures of tracking performance. The results of the series of three experiments illustrate the sensitivity of the P300 to the processing requirements of a complex target acquisition task.

This question was investigated by having subjects detect some visual probes while performing a primary task that involved identification. The probes were located in the neighbourhood of highly or poorly informative parts of the identified stimuli. Three experiments that followed this rationale were conducted. In Experiment I, it was found that when subjects searched for a target letter in lines of identical background letters, they detected more dots near the feature that distinguished between the target and the background letters. In Experiment II, it was found that native Hebrew-speaking subjects detected more lines above a letter that distinguished between two English words. Experiment III showed that the effect was reduced but did not vanish when spatial uncertainty was introduced. On the whole, the data are interpreted as suggesting that more attention may indeed be directed to informative regions, and that this effect cannot be solely attributed to retinal factors. © 1983, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Capacity demand is assessed by impairment in performance on a secondary probe detection task at the moment of encoding on the primary task. The results support Comstock's (1973) conclusion that stimulus encoding does require processing capacity and relate capacity demand to the level of encoding difficulty. Evidence suggests that it costs more capacity to share attention between two modalities rather than within one.
