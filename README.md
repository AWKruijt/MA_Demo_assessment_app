# MA_Demo_assessment_app

This repos holds a demo version of the assessment app used in a meta-analysis of baseline bias assessed in RCTs of Attention Bias Modification. The preprint of this MA can be found here: https://psyarxiv.com/rfjup

The .rmd file in this repos is the originally used script. The file App.R is a slightly adapted version allowing users to run the app by running the following code in Rstudio: runGitHub("AWKruijt/MA_Demo_assessment_app")

By now, I have further developed similar code based on the here presented code for a new project. Anyone interested in using this code: feel free to contact me for updated/more streamlined/user-friendlier code.
